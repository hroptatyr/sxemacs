CHANGES-msw

This file briefly describes all mswindows-specific changes to XEmacs
in the OXYMORON series of releases. The mswindows release branch
contains additional changes on top of the mainline XEmacs
release. These changes are deemed necessary for XEmacs to be fully
functional under mswindows. It is not intended that these changes
cause problems on UNIX systems, but they have not been tested on UNIX
platforms. Caveat Emptor.

See the file 'CHANGES-release' for a full list of mainline changes.
