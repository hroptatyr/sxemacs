  "Etags facility for Emacs.

This lib provides some useful tools for working with TAGS tables
that were created with the etags binary \(also distributed with this
emacs\)."
  :prefix "tags-"
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom tags-build-completion-table t
  "*When non-nil, build a completion table from all known tags.
Otherwise disable tag completion."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'etags)

(defcustom tags-always-exact nil
  "*If this variable is non-nil, then tags always looks for exact matches.
If it is nil (the default), tags will first go through exact matches,
then through the non-exact ones."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'etags)

(defcustom tag-table-alist nil
  "*A list which determines which tags files are active for a buffer.
This is not really an association list, in that all elements are
checked.  The CAR of each element of this list is a pattern against
which the buffer's file name is compared; if it matches, then the CDR
of the list should be the name of the tags table to use.  If more than
one element of this list matches the buffer's file name, then all of
the associated tags tables will be used.  Earlier ones will be
searched first.

If the CAR of elements of this list are strings, then they are treated
as regular-expressions against which the file is compared (like the
auto-mode-alist).  If they are not strings, then they are evaluated.
If they evaluate to non-nil, then the current buffer is considered to
match.

If the CDR of the elements of this list are strings, then they are
assumed to name a TAGS file.  If they name a directory, then the string
\"TAGS\" is appended to them to get the file name.  If they are not 
strings, then they are evaluated, and must return an appropriate string.

For example:
  (setq tag-table-alist
	'((\"/usr/src/public/perl/\" . \"/usr/src/public/perl/perl-3.0/\")
	 (\"\\\\.el$\" . \"/usr/local/emacs/src/\")
	 (\"/jbw/gnu/\" . \"/usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/\")
	 (\"\" . \"/usr/local/emacs/src/\")
	 ))

This means that anything in the /usr/src/public/perl/ directory should use
the TAGS file /usr/src/public/perl/perl-3.0/TAGS; and file ending in .el should
use the TAGS file /usr/local/emacs/src/TAGS; and anything in or below the
directory /jbw/gnu/ should use the TAGS file /usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/TAGS.
A file called something like \"/usr/jbw/foo.el\" would use both the TAGS files
/usr/local/emacs/src/TAGS and /usr15/degree/stud/jbw/gnu/TAGS (in that order)
because it matches both patterns.

If the buffer-local variable `buffer-tag-table' is set, then it names a tags
table that is searched before all others when find-tag is executed from this
buffer.

If there is a file called \"TAGS\" in the same directory as the file in 
question, then that tags file will always be used as well (after the
`buffer-tag-table' but before the tables specified by this list.)

If the variable tags-file-name is set, then the tags file it names will apply
to all buffers (for backwards compatibility.)  It is searched first."

It is slower for large tables and less precise than the other option.
