;; Modified for 19.11 by Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart <pelegri@eng.sun.com>
;;		      and Chuck Thompson <cthomp@xemacs.org>
;; More hacking for 19.12 by Chuck Thompson and Ben Wing.
;; 19.13 and 19.14 updating done by Chuck Thompson.
;; 19.15 and 20.0 updating done by Steve Baur and Martin Buchholz.

;; Completely rewritten for 20.3 by Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org>.
;; The original had no version numbers; I numbered the rewrite as 2.0.
;; Extensively revamped and most text rewritten by Ben Wing
;; <ben@xemacs.org> for 21.4.

;; Revamped again by Steve Youngs <steve@sxemacs.org> for SXEmacs.
;; Lets call it version 3.0 of this file.

;; Many things in this file are to gag.  Ideally, we should just use
;; HTML (or some other extension, e.g. info) for this sort of thing.
;; However, W3 loads too long and is too large to be dumped with
;; XEmacs.

;; If you think this is ugly now -- o boy, you should have seen it
;; before.

At the time of the inception of Lucid Emacs (the former name of
XEmacs), Lucid's latest product was Energize, a C/C++ development
environment.  Rather than invent (and force our users to learn) a new
user interface, we chose to build part of our environment on top of
the world's best editor, GNU Emacs.  (Though our product is
commercial, the work we did on GNU Emacs is free software, and is
useful in its own right.)

We needed a version of Emacs with mouse-sensitive regions, multiple
fonts, the ability to mark sections of a buffer as read-only, the
ability to detect which parts of a buffer have been modified, and many
other features.

For our purposes, the existing version of Epoch was not sufficient; it
did not allow us to put arbitrary pixmaps/icons in buffers, `undo' did
not restore changes to regions, regions did not overlap and merge
their attributes in the way we needed, and several other things.

We could have devoted our time to making Epoch do what we needed (and,
in fact, we spent some time doing that in 1990) but, since the FSF
planned to include Epoch-like features in their version 19, we decided
that our efforts would be better spent improving Emacs 19 instead of
Epoch.

Our original hope was that our changes to Emacs would be incorporated
into the \"official\" v19.  However, scheduling conflicts arose, and
we found that, given the amount of work still remaining to be done, we
didn't have the time or manpower to do the level of coordination that
would be necessary to get our changes accepted by the FSF.
Consequently, we released our work as a forked branch of Emacs,
instead of delaying any longer.

Roughly a year after Lucid Emacs 19.0 was released, a beta version of
the FSF branch of Emacs 19 was released.  The FSF version is better in
some areas, and worse in others, as reflects the differing focus of
our development efforts.

We plan to continue developing and supporting Lucid Emacs, and merging
in bug fixes and new features from the FSF branch as appropriate; we
do not plan to discard any of the functionality that we implemented
which RMS has chosen not to include in his version.

Certain elements of Lucid Emacs, or derivatives of them, have been
ported to the FSF version.  We have not been doing work in this
direction, because we feel that Lucid Emacs has a cleaner and more
extensible substrate, and that any kind of merger between the two
branches would be far easier by merging the FSF changes into our
version than the other way around.

We have been working closely with the Epoch developers to merge in the
remaining Epoch functionality which Lucid Emacs does not yet have.
Epoch and Lucid Emacs will soon be one and the same thing.  Work is
being done on a compatibility package which will allow Epoch 4 code to
run in XEmacs with little or no change.\n\n"

     "\n
Emacs 18 has been around for a long, long time.  Version 19 was
supposed to be the successor to v18 with X support.  It was going to
be available \"real soon\" for a long time (some people remember
hearing about v19 as early as 1984!), but it never came out.  v19
development was going very, very slowly, and from the outside it
seemed that it was not moving at all.  In the meantime other people
gave up waiting for v19 and decided to build their own X-aware
Emacsen.  The most important of these was probably Epoch, which came
from the University of Illinois (\"UofI\") and was based on v18.

Around 1990, the Developer Products group within Sun Microsystems
Inc., decided that it wanted an integrated editor.  (This group is now
known as DevPro.  It used to be known as SunPro - the name was changed
in mid-1994.)  They contracted with the University of Illinois to
provide a number of basic enhancements to the functionality in Epoch.
UofI initially was planning to deliver this on top of Epoch code.

In the meantime, (actually some time before they talked with UofI)
Lucid had decided that it also wanted to provide an integrated
environment with an integrated editor.  Lucid decided that the Version
19 base was a better one than Version 18 and thus decided not to use
Epoch but instead to work with Richard Stallman, the head of the Free
Software Foundation and principal author of Emacs, on getting v19 out.
At some point Stallman and Lucid parted ways.  Lucid kept working and
got a v19 out that they called Lucid Emacs 19.

After Lucid's v19 came out it became clear to us (the UofI and Sun)
that the right thing to do was to push for an integration of both
Lucid Emacs and Epoch, and to get the deliverables that Sun was asking
from the University of Illinois on top of this integrated platform.
Until 1994, Sun and Lucid both actively supported XEmacs as part of
their product suite and invested a comparable amount of effort into
it.  Substantial portions of the current code have originated under
the support of Sun, either directly within Sun, or at UofI but paid
for by Sun.  This code was kept away from Lucid for a while, but later
was made available to them.  Initially Lucid didn't know that Sun was
supporting UofI, but later Sun was open about it.

Around 1992 DevPro-originated code started showing up in Lucid Emacs,
starting with the infusion of the Epoch redisplay code.  The separate
code bases at Lucid, Sun, and the University of Illinois were merged,
allowing a single XEmacs to evolve from that point on.

Sun originally called the integrated product ERA, for \"Emacs
Rewritten Again\".  SunPro and Lucid eventually came to an agreement
to find a name for the product that was not specific to either
company.  An additional constraint that Lucid placed on the name was
that it must contain the word \"Emacs\" in it -- thus \"ERA\" was not
acceptable.  The tentatively agreed-upon name was \"XEmacs\", and this
has been the name of the program since version 19.11.)

As of 1997, Sun is shipping XEmacs as part of its Developer Products
integrated programming environment \"Sun WorkShop\".  Sun is
continuing to support XEmacs development, with focus on
internationalization and quality improvement.\n\n"

work on XEmacs in order to hasten the development of Mule support
\(i.e. support for Japanese, Chinese, etc.) in XEmacs and as a gesture
of goodwill towards the XEmacs community for all the work they have
done on making a powerful, modern, freely available text editor.
Through this contract, Amdahl provided a large amount of work in
XEmacs in the form of rewriting the basic text-processing mechanisms
to allow for Mule support and writing a large amount of the support
for multiple devices.

Yes, that should say \"...Advantages over XEmacs\", but at the time of
the current SXEmacs release, the only real difference between SXEmacs
and XEmacs is the name.  Hey, we've only just begun. :-) Rest assured
that this will not be the case in the near future.

So, for now at least, here are the advantages over GNU/Emacs...

* Much better GUI support:

  -- a real toolbar
  -- more comprehensive and better-designed menubars
  -- horizontal and vertical scrollbars in all windows
  -- proper dialog boxes
  -- tabs for selecting buffers
  -- support for variable-width and variable height fonts
  -- support for arbitrary pixmaps and widgets in a buffer
  -- face support on TTY's, including color

* An installable package system, with a huge number of packages available
  that have been tested and are known to work with the latest version
  of SXEmacs.

* Comprehensive support for the GTK toolkit.

* An open development community, with contributions welcome and no need
  to sign over your copyright to any organization. (Please send
  contributions to sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org.  See http://www.sxemacs.org
  for more information on SXEmacs mailing lists, and other info.)

* Support for display on multiple simultaneous X and/or TTY devices.

* Powerful, flexible control over the display characteristics of most
  of the visual aspects of SXEmacs through the use of specifiers, which
  allow separate values to be specified for individual buffers,
  windows, frames, devices, device classes, and device types.

* A clean, modern, abstracted Lisp interface to the menubar, toolbar,
  window-system events, key combinations, extents (regions in a buffer
  with specific properties), and all other display aspects.

* Proper integration with Xt and Motif (including Motif menubars and
  scrollbars).  Motif look-alike menubars and scrollbars are provided
  for those systems without real Motif support.

* Many improvements to the multilingual support, such as the ability to
  enter text for complex languages using the XIM mechanism and
  localization of menubar text for the Japanese locale.

    ===============
    Oh daddy with your fingers pink 
    From whose udders do you drink? 
    Thy milk offends with putrid stink 
    I'll vomit now, lactose I think 

    If I could dream, I'd be a cow

    Of teens approaching o'er the grounds 
    To tip with glee, then screech like clowns 

    And so I stare into this glass 
    Of sweaty juice, I gulp so fast 
    Each drop I lick, down to the last 
    The vertigo I know will pass 

    My mother smiles and pats my head 
    She's proud of me, so she has said 
    My pop just now gets out of bed 
    His eyes quite comatose and red 

    He'll empathize my milky fate 
    Whilest sopping gravy from his plate 
    And as the hour is getting late 
    His belly taut with all he ate 

    He isn't often quite so chatty
