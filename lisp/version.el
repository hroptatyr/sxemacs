;; Sadly, our `emacs-version' causes a problem for Dired.  This is because
;; Dired uses some regex matching against `emacs-version' instead of simply
;; using the "standard" `emacs-*-version' variables.  The following trivial
;; patch to dired.el will fix Dired for you.  I have already been in touch
;; with the Dired maintainers about this. --SY.
