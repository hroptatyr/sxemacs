;;; Synched up with: Not synched with FSF.

;; Commentary:

;; This is based on an early Emacs 19 info.el file.
;;
;; Note that Info-directory has been replaced by Info-directory-list,
;; a search path of directories in which to find Info files.
;; Also, Info tries adding ".info" to a file name if the name itself
;; is not found.
;;
;; See the change log below for further details.

;; Change Log:

;; Modified 3/7/1991 by Dave Gillespie:
;; (Author's address: daveg@synaptics.com or daveg@csvax.cs.caltech.edu)
;;
;; Added keys:  i, t, <, >, [, ], {, }, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.
;; Look at help for info-mode (type ? in Info) for descriptions.
;;
;; If Info-directory-list is undefined and there is no INFOPATH
;; in the environment, use value of Info-directory for compatibility
;; with Emacs 18.57.
;;
;; All files named "localdir" found in the path are appended to "dir",
;; the Info directory.  For this to work, "dir" should contain only
;; one node (Top), and each "localdir" should contain no ^_ or ^L
;; characters.  Generally they will contain only one or several
;; additional lines for the top-level menu.  Note that "dir" is
;; modified in memory each time it is loaded, but not on disk.
;;
;; If "dir" contains a line of the form:  "* Locals:"
;; then the "localdir"s are inserted there instead of at the end.


;; Modified 4/3/1991 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Added Info-mode-hook (suggested by Sebastian Kremer).
;; Also added epoch-info-startup/select-hooks from Simon Spero's info.el.
;;
;; Added automatic decoding of compressed Info files.
;; See documentation for the variable Info-suffix-list.  Default is to
;; run "uncompress" on ".Z" files and "unyabba" on ".Y" files.
;; (See comp.sources.unix v24i073-076 for yabba/unyabba, a free software
;; alternative to compress/uncompress.)
;; Note: "dir" and "localdir" files should not be compressed.
;;
;; Changed variables like Info-enable-edit to be settable by M-x set-variable.
;;
;; Added Info-auto-advance variable.  If t, SPC and DEL will act like
;; } and {, i.e., they advance to the next/previous node if at the end
;; of the buffer.
;;
;; Changed `u' to restore point to most recent location in that node.
;; Added `=' to do this manually at any time.  (Suggested by David Fox).
;;
;; Changed `m' and `0-9' to try interpreting menu name as a file name
;; if not found as a node name.  This allows (dir) menus of the form,
;;     Emacs::		Cool text editor
;; as a shorthand for
;;     Emacs:(emacs).	Cool text editor
;;
;; Enhanced `i' to use line-number information in the index.
;; Added `,' to move among all matches to a previous `i' command.
;;
;; Added `a' (Info-annotate) for adding personal notes to any Info node.
;; Notes are not stored in the actual Info files, but in the user's own
;; ~/.infonotes file.
;;
;; Added Info-footnote-tag, made default be "Ref" instead of "Note".
;;
;; Got mouse-click stuff to work under Emacs version 18.  Check it out!
;; Left and right clicks scroll the Info window.
;; Middle click goes to clicked-on node, e.g., "Next:", a menu, or a note.


;; Modified 6/29/1991 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Renamed epoch-info-startup/select-hooks to Info-startup/select-hook.
;;
;; Made Info-select-node into a command on the `!' key.
;;
;; Added Info-mouse-support user option.
;;
;; Cleaned up the implementation of some routines.
;;
;; Added special treatment of quoted words in annotations:  The `g'
;; command for a nonexistent node name scans for an annotation
;; (in any node of any file) containing that name in quotes:  g foo RET
;; looks for an annotation containing:  "foo"  or:  <<foo>>
;; If found, it goes to that file and node.
;;
;; Added a call to set up Info-directory-list in Info-find-node to
;; work around a bug in GNUS where it calls Info-goto-node before info.
;;
;; Added completion for `g' command (inspired by Richard Kim's infox.el).
;; Completion knows all node names for the current file, and all annotation
;; tags (see above).  It does not complete file names or node names in
;; other files.
;;
;; Added `k' (Info-emacs-key) and `*' (Info-elisp-ref) commands.  You may
;; wish to bind these to global keys outside of Info mode.
;;
;; Allowed localdir files to be full dir-like files; only the menu part
;; of each localdir is copied.  Also, redundant menu items are omitted.
;;
;; Changed Info-history to hold only one entry at a time for each node,
;; and to be circular so that multiple `l's come back again to the most
;; recent node.  Note that the format of Info-history entries has changed,
;; which may interfere with external programs that try to operate on it.
;; (Also inspired by Kim's infox.el).
;;
;; Changed `n', `]', `l', etc. to accept prefix arguments to move several
;; steps at once.  Most accept negative arguments to move oppositely.
;;
;; Changed `?' to bury *Help* buffer afterwards to keep it out of the way.
;;
;; Rearranged `?' key's display to be a little better for new users.
;;
;; Changed `a' to save whole window configuration and restore on C-c C-c.
;;
;; Fixed the bug reported by Bill Reynolds on gnu.emacs.bugs.
;;
;; Changed Info-last to restore window-start as well as cursor position.
;;
;; Changed middle mouse button in space after end of node to do Info-last
;; if we got here by following a cross reference, else do Info-global-next.
;;
;; Added some new mouse bindings: shift-left = Info-global-next,
;; shift-right = Info-global-prev, shift-middle = Info-last.
;;
;; Fixed Info-follow-reference not to make assumptions about length
;; of Info-footnote-tag [Linus Tolke].
;;
;; Changed default for Info-auto-advance mode to be press-twice-for-next-node.
;;
;; Modified x-mouse-ignore to preserve last-command variable, so that
;; press-twice Info-auto-advance mode works with the mouse.


;; Modified 3/4/1992 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Added an "autoload" command to help autoload.el.
;;
;; Changed `*' command to look for file `elisp' as well as for `lispref'.
;;
;; Fixed a bug involving footnote names containing regexp special characters.
;;
;; Fixed a bug in completion during `f' (or `r') command.
;;
;; Added TAB (Info-next-reference), M-TAB, and RET keys to Info mode.
;;
;; Added new bindings, `C-h C-k' for Info-emacs-key and `C-h C-f' for
;; Info-elisp-ref.  These bindings are made when info.el is loaded, and
;; only if those key sequences were previously unbound.  These bindings
;; work at any time, not just when Info is already running.


;; Modified 3/8/1992 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Fixed some long lines that were causing trouble with mailers.


;; Modified 3/9/1992 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Added `C-h C-i' (Info-query).
;;
;; Added Info-novice mode, warns if the user attempts to switch to
;; a different Info file.
;;
;; Fixed a bug that caused problems using compressed Info files
;; and Info-directory-list at the same time.
;;
;; Disabled Info-mouse-support by default if Epoch or Hyperbole is in use.
;;
;; Added an expand-file-name call to Info-find-node to fix a small bug.


;; Modified 5/22/1992 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Added "standalone" operation:  "emacs -f info" runs Emacs specifically
;; for use as an Info browser.  In this mode, the `q' key quits Emacs
;; itself.  Also, "emacs -f info arg" starts in Info file "arg" instead
;; of "dir".
;;
;; Changed to prefer "foo.info" over "foo".  If both exist, "foo" is
;; probably a directory or executable program!
;;
;; Made control-mouse act like regular-mouse does in other buffers.
;; (In most systems, this will be set-cursor for left-mouse, x-cut
;; for right-mouse, and x-paste, which will be an error, for
;; middle-mouse.)
;;
;; Improved prompting and searching for `,' key.
;;
;; Fixed a bug where some "* Menu:" lines disappeared when "dir"
;; contained several nodes.


;; Modified 9/10/1992 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Mixed in support for XEmacs.  Mouse works the same as in
;; the other Emacs versions by default; added Info-lucid-mouse-style
;; variable, which enables mouse operation similar to XEmacs's default.
;;
;; Fixed a bug where RET couldn't understand "* Foo::" if "Foo" was a
;; file name instead of a node name.
;;
;; Added `x' (Info-bookmark), a simple interface to the annotation
;; tags feature.  Added `j' (Info-goto-bookmark), like `g' but only
;; completes bookmarks.
;;
;; Added `<<tag>>' as alternate to `"tag"' in annotations.
;;
;; Added `v' (Info-visit-file), like Info-goto-node but specialized
;; for going to a new Info file (with file name completion).
;;
;; Added recognition of gzip'd ".z" files.


;; Modified 5/9/1993 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Merged in various things from FSF's latest Emacs 19 info.el.

;; Modified 6/2/1993 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Changed to use new suffix ".gz" for gzip files.


;; Modified 7/22/1993 by Dave Gillespie:
;;
;; Changed Info-footnote-tag to "See" instead of "Ref".
;;
;; Extended Info-fontify-node to work with FSF version of Emacs 19.

;; Modified 7/30/1993 by Jamie Zawinski:
;;
;; Commented out the tty and fsf19 mouse support, because why bother.
;; Commented out the politically incorrect version of XEmacs mouse support.
;; Commented out mouse scrolling bindings because the party line on that
;;  is "scrollbars are coming soon."
;; Commented out munging of help-for-help's doc; put it in help.el.
;; Did Info-edit-map the modern XEmacs way.
;; Pruned extra cruft from fontification and mouse handling code.
;; Fixed ASCII-centric bogosity in unreading of events.

;; Modified 8/11/95 by Chuck Thompson:
;;
;; Removed any pretense of ever referencing Info-directory since it
;; wasn't working anyhow.

;; Modified 4/5/97 by Tomasz J. Cholewo:
;;
;; Modified Info-search to use with-caps-disable-folding

;; Modified 6/21/97 by Hrvoje Niksic
;;
;; Fixed up Info-next-reference to work sanely when n < 0.
;; Added S-tab binding.

;; Modified 1997-07-10 by Karl M. Hegbloom
;;
;; Added `Info-minibuffer-history'
;; (also added to defaults in "lisp/utils/savehist.el")
;;  Other changes in main ChangeLog.

;; Modified 1998-03-29 by Oscar Figueiredo
;;
;; Added automatic dir/localdir (re)building capability for directories that
;; contain none or when it has become older than info files in the same
;; directory.

;; Modified 1998-09-23 by Didier Verna <didier@xemacs.org>

discusses one topic and contains references to other nodes
which discuss related topics.  Info has commands to follow
the references and show you other nodes.

h	Invoke the Info tutorial.
q	Quit Info: return to the previously selected file or buffer.

Selecting other nodes:
n	Move to the \"next\" node of this node.
p	Move to the \"previous\" node of this node.
m	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
1-9, 0	Pick first..ninth, last item in node's menu.
	Menu items select nodes that are \"subsections\" of this node.
u	Move \"up\" from this node (i.e., from a subsection to a section).
f or r	Follow a cross reference by name (or abbrev).  Type `l' to get back.
RET     Follow cross reference or menu item indicated by cursor.
i	Look up a topic in this file's Index and move to that node.
,	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous `i' command.
l	(letter L) Move back to the last node you were in.

Moving within a node:
Space	Scroll forward a full screen.   DEL       Scroll backward.
b	Go to beginning of node.        Meta->    Go to end of node.
TAB	Go to next cross-reference.     Meta-TAB  Go to previous ref.

Mouse commands:
Left Button	Set point (usual text-mode functionality)
Middle Button	Click on a highlighted node reference to go to it.
Right Button	Pop up a menu of applicable Info commands.

Left Button Double Click in window edges:
 Top edge:    Go up to the parent node, like `u'.
 Left edge:   Go to the previous node, like `p'.
 Right edge:  Go to the next node, like `n'.
 Bottom edge: Follow first menu item, like `1'.

Advanced commands:
g	Move to node, file, or annotation tag specified by name.
	Examples:  `g Rectangles' `g (Emacs)Rectangles' `g Emacs'.
v	Move to file, with filename completion.
k	Look up a key sequence in Emacs manual (also C-h C-k at any time).
*	Look up a function name in Emacs Lisp manual (also C-h C-f).
d	Go to the main directory of Info files.
< or t	Go to Top (first) node of this file.
>	Go to last node in this file.
\[	Go to previous node, treating file as one linear document.
\]	Go to next node, treating file as one linear document.
{	Scroll backward, or go to previous node if at top.
}	Scroll forward, or go to next node if at bottom.
=	Restore cursor position from last time in this node.
a	Add a private note (annotation) to the current node.
x, j	Add, jump to a bookmark (annotation tag).
s	Search this Info file for a node containing the specified regexp.
e	Edit the contents of the current node."
