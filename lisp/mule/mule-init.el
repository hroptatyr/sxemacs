;;; IMPORTANT NOTICE -- DON'T EDIT THIS FILE!!!
;;;  Keep this file unmodified for further patches being applied successfully.
;;;  All language specific basic environments are defined here.
;;;  By default, Japanese is set as the primary environment.
;;;  You can change primary environment in `./lisp/site-init.el by
;;;  `set-primary-environment'.  For instance,
;;;  	(set-primary-environment 'chinese)
;;;  makes Chinese the primary environment.
;;;  If you are still not satisfied with the settings, you can
;;;  override them after the above line.  For instance,
;;;  	(set-default-buffer-file-coding-system 'big5)
;;;  makes big5 be used for file I/O by default.
;;;  If you are not satisfied with other default settings in this file,
;;;  override any of them also in `./lisp/site-init.el'.  For instance,
;;;	(define-program-coding-system nil ".*mail.*" 'iso-8859-1)
;;;  makes the coding-system 'iso-8859-1 be used in mail.
