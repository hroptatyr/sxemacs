;;; Commentary:

;; This file is dumped with XEmacs.

;; These are default settings for names of certain files and directories
;; that Emacs needs to refer to from time to time.

;; If these settings are not right, override them with `setq'
;; in site-start.el.  Do not change this file.

;;; Code:

;Note: FSF's version is:
;(defvar Info-default-directory-list
;  (let ((start (list "/usr/local/lib/info/"
;		      ;; This comes second so that, if it is the same
;		      ;; as configure-info-directory (which is usually true)
;		      ;; and Emacs has been installed (also usually true)
;		      ;; then the list will end with two copies of this;
;		      ;; which means that the last dir file Info-insert-dir
;		      ;; finds will be the one in this directory.
;		      "/usr/local/info/"))
;	 (configdir (file-name-as-directory configure-info-directory)))
;    (setq start (nconc start (list configdir)))

;  "List of directories to search for Info documentation files.
;They are searched in the order they are given in this list.
;Therefore, the directory of Info files that come with Emacs
;normally should come last (so that local files override standard ones).")
