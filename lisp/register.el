;;; Commentary:

;; This file is dumped with XEmacs.

;; This package of functions emulates and somewhat extends the venerable
;; TECO's `register' feature, which permits you to save various useful
;; pieces of buffer state to named variables.  The entry points are
;; documented in the Emacs user's manual.

;;; Code:

(defvar register-alist nil
  "Alist of elements (NAME . CONTENTS), one for each Emacs register.
NAME is a character (a number).  CONTENTS is a string, number, marker or list.
A list of strings represents a rectangle.
A list of the form (file . NAME) represents the file named NAME.
A list of the form (file-query NAME POSITION) represents position POSITION
 in the file named NAME, but query before visiting it.
A list of the form (WINDOW-CONFIGURATION POSITION)
 represents a saved window configuration plus a saved value of point.
A list of the form (FRAME-CONFIGURATION POSITION)
 represents a saved frame configuration plus a saved value of point.")
