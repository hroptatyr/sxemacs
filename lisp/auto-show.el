;; This file provides functions that
;; automatically scroll the window horizontally when the point moves
;; off the left or right side of the window.

;; Once this library is loaded, automatic horizontal scrolling
;; occurs whenever long lines are being truncated.
;; To request truncation of long lines, set the variable
;; Setting the variable `truncate-lines' to non-nil.
;; You can do this for all buffers as follows:
;;
;; (set-default 'truncate-lines t)

;; Here is how to do it for C mode only:
;;
;; (set-default 'truncate-lines nil)	; this is the original value
;; (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
;;   "Run when C-mode starts up.  Changes ..."
;;   ... set various personal preferences ...
;;   (setq truncate-lines t))
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
;;
;;
;; As a finer level of control, you can still have truncated lines but
;; without the automatic horizontal scrolling by setting the buffer
;; local variable `auto-show-mode' to nil.  The default value is t.
;; The command `auto-show-mode' toggles the value of the variable
;; `auto-show-mode'.

;;; Code:

(defgroup auto-show nil
  "Perform automatic horizontal scrolling as point moves."
  :group 'display
  :group 'extensions)

;; This is preloaded, so we don't need special :set, :require, etc.
(defcustom auto-show-mode t
  "*Non-nil enables automatic horizontal scrolling, when lines are truncated.
The default value is t.  To change the default, do this:
	(set-default 'auto-show-mode nil)
See also command `auto-show-mode'.
This variable has no effect when lines are not being truncated.
This variable is automatically local in each buffer where it is set."
