;; If and only if zmacs-regions is true:

;; When a mark is pushed and the region goes into the "active" state, we
;; assert it as the Primary selection.  This causes it to be hilighted.
;; When the region goes into the "inactive" state, we disown the Primary
;; selection, causing the region to be dehilighted.

;; Note that it is possible for the region to be in the "active" state
;; and not be hilighted, if it is in the active state and then some other
;; application asserts the selection.  This is probably not a big deal.
