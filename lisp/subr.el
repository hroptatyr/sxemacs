When a hook is local, its local and global values

This function works by making `t' a member of the buffer-local value,
which acts as a flag to run the hook functions in the default value as
well.  This works for all normal hooks, but does not work for most
non-normal hooks yet.  We will be changing the callers of non-normal
hooks so that they can handle localness; this has to be done one by
one.

the substrings between the splitting points are collected as a list,

If SEPARATORS is non-nil, it should be a regular expression matching text
which separates, but is not part of, the substrings.  If nil it defaults to
`split-string-default-separators', normally \"[ \\f\\t\\n\\r\\v]+\", and
OMIT-NULLS is forced to t.

If OMIT-NULLS is t, zero-length substrings are omitted from the list \(so
that for the default value of SEPARATORS leading and trailing whitespace
are effectively trimmed).  If nil, all zero-length substrings are retained,
which correctly parses CSV format, for example.

Note that the effect of `(split-string STRING)' is the same as
`(split-string STRING split-string-default-separators t)').  In the rare

;;; Error functions

(defun error (datum &rest args)
  "Signal a non-continuable error.
DATUM should normally be an error symbol, i.e. a symbol defined using
`define-error'.  ARGS will be made into a list, and DATUM and ARGS passed
as the two arguments to `signal', the most basic error handling function.

This error is not continuable: you cannot continue execution after the
error using the debugger `r' command.  See also `cerror'.

The correct semantics of ARGS varies from error to error, but for most
errors that need to be generated in Lisp code, the first argument
should be a string describing the *context* of the error (i.e. the
exact operation being performed and what went wrong), and the remaining
arguments or \"frobs\" (most often, there is one) specify the
offending object(s) and/or provide additional details such as the exact
error when a file error occurred, e.g.:

-- the buffer in which an editing error occurred.
-- an invalid value that was encountered. (In such cases, the string
   should describe the purpose or \"semantics\" of the value [e.g. if the
   value is an argument to a function, the name of the argument; if the value
   is the value corresponding to a keyword, the name of the keyword; if the
   value is supposed to be a list length, say this and say what the purpose
   of the list is; etc.] as well as specifying why the value is invalid, if
   that's not self-evident.)
-- the file in which an error occurred. (In such cases, there should be a
   second frob, probably a string, specifying the exact error that occurred.
   This does not occur in the string that precedes the first frob, because
   that frob describes the exact operation that was happening.

For historical compatibility, DATUM can also be a string.  In this case,
DATUM and ARGS are passed together as the arguments to `format', and then
an error is signalled using the error symbol `error' and formatted string.
Although this usage of `error' is very common, it is deprecated because it
totally defeats the purpose of having structured errors.  There is now
a rich set of defined errors you can use:

The five most common errors you will probably use or base your new
errors off of are `syntax-error', `invalid-argument', `invalid-state',
`invalid-operation', and `invalid-change'.  Note the semantic differences:

-- `syntax-error' is for errors in complex structures: parsed strings, lists,
   and the like.
-- `invalid-argument' is for errors in a simple value.  Typically, the entire
   value, not just one part of it, is wrong.
-- `invalid-state' means that some settings have been changed in such a way
   that their current state is unallowable.  More and more, code is being
   written more carefully, and catches the error when the settings are being
   changed, rather than afterwards.  This leads us to the next error:
-- `invalid-change' means that an attempt is being made to change some settings
   into an invalid state.  `invalid-change' is a type of `invalid-operation'.
-- `invalid-operation' refers to all cases where code is trying to do something
   that's disallowed.  This includes file errors, buffer errors (e.g. running
   off the end of a buffer), `invalid-change' as just mentioned, and
   arithmetic errors.
