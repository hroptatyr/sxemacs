;;; Commentary:

;; The Idea:
;; Let SXEmacs report interesting aspects of how it was built.

;; The Concept:
;; User creates an SXEmacs Build Report by just calling
;; M-x build-rpt
;; which will initialise a mail buffer with relevant information
;; derived from the SXEmacs build process. Point is left at the
;; beginning of the report for user to input some personal notes and
;; send the report.

;; The Status:
;; This is the first `Proof of Concept'.

;; The Author:
;; Adrian Aichner, Teradyne GmbH Munich, Sun., Apr. 20, 1997.

;; First update for SXEmacs 2004-12-07 by Steve Youngs.

;; Renamed to build-rpt so it doesn't conflict with build-report.el in
;;   XEmacs package "build" -- 2006-01-21 by Steve Youngs.

;;; Code:

(require 'config)
(require 'custom)
(require 'cl)

;; gag the byte-compiler... we really do know what we are doing
