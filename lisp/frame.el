  "Plist of frame properties for creating the initial X window frame.
You can set this in your `.emacs' file; for example,
  (setq initial-frame-plist '(top 1 left 1 width 80 height 55))
Properties specified here supersede the values given in `default-frame-plist'.
The format of this can also be an alist for backward compatibility.

If the value calls for a frame without a minibuffer, and you have not created
a minibuffer frame on your own, one is created according to
`minibuffer-frame-plist'.

You can specify geometry-related options for just the initial frame
by setting this variable in your `.emacs' file; however, they won't
take effect until Emacs reads `.emacs', which happens after first creating
the frame.  If you want the frame to have the proper geometry as soon
as it appears, you need to use this three-step process:
* Specify X resources to give the geometry you want.
* Set `default-frame-plist' to override these options so that they
  don't affect subsequent frames.
* Set `initial-frame-plist' in a way that matches the X resources,
  to override what you put in `default-frame-plist'."
