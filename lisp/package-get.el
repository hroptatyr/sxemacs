;;; Commentary:

;; package-get -
;;	Retrieve a package and any other required packages from an archive
;;
;;
;; Note (JV): Most of this no longer applies!  
;; Note (SY): Definitely no longer applies, but I'm leaving these
;;            comments here because there are some nifty ideas here.
;;
;; The idea:
;;	A new XEmacs lisp-only release is generated with the following steps:
;;	1. The maintainer runs some yet to be written program that
;;	   generates all the dependency information.  This should
;;	   determine all the require and provide statements and associate
;;	   them with a package.
;;	2. All the packages are then bundled into their own tar balls
;;	   (or whatever format)
;;	3. Maintainer automatically generates a new `package-get-base'
;;	   data structure which contains information such as the
;;	   package name, the file to be retrieved, an md5 checksum,
;;	   etc (see `package-get-base').
;;	4. The maintainer posts an announcement with the new version
;;	   of `package-get-base'.
;;	5. A user/system manager saves this posting and runs
;;	   `package-get-update' which uses the previously saved list
;;	   of packages, `package-get-here' that the user/site
;;	   wants to determine what new versions to download and
;;	   install.
;;
;;	A user/site manager can generate a new `package-get-here' structure
;;	by using `package-get-setup' which generates a customize like
;;	interface to the list of packages.  The buffer looks something
;;	like:
;;
;;	gnus	- a mail and news reader
;;	[]	Always install
;;	[]	Needs updating
;;	[]	Required by other [packages]
;;	version: 2.0
;;
;;	vm	- a mail reader
;;	[]	Always install
;;	[]	Needs updating
;;	[]	Required by other [packages]
;;
;;	Where `[]' indicates a toggle box
;;
;;	- Clicking on "Always install" puts this into
;;	  `package-get-here' list.  "Needs updating" indicates a new
;;	  version is available.  Anything already in
;;	  `package-get-here' has this enabled.
;;	- "Required by other" means some other packages are going to force
;;	  this to be installed.  Clicking on  [packages] gives a list
;;	  of packages that require this.
;;
;;	The `package-get-base' should be installed in a file in
;;	`data-directory'.  The `package-get-here' should be installed in
;;	site-lisp.  Both are then read at run time.
;;
;; TODO:
;;	- Implement `package-get-setup'
;;	- Actually put `package-get-base' and `package-get-here' into
;;	  files that are read.
;;	- SOMEONE needs to write the programs that generate the
;;	  provides/requires database and makes it into a lisp data
;;	  structure suitable for `package-get-base'
;;	- Handle errors such as no package providing a required symbol.
;;	- Tie this into the `require' function to download packages
;;	  transparently.

  "List of packages that are installed at this site.
For each element in the alist,  car is the package name and the cdr is
a plist containing information about the package.   Typical fields
kept in the plist are:

version		- version of this package
provides	- list of symbols provided
requires	- list of symbols that are required.
		  These in turn are provided by other packages.
filename	- name of the file.
size		- size of the file (aka the bundled package)
md5sum		- computed md5 checksum
description	- What this package is for.
type		- Whether this is a 'binary (default) or 'single file package

More fields may be added as needed.  An example:

'(
 (name
  (version \"<version 2>\"
   file \"filename\"
   description \"what this package is about.\"
   provides (<list>)
   requires (<list>)
   size <integer-bytes>
   md5sum \"<checksum\"

  (version \"<version 1>\"
   file \"filename\"
   description \"what this package is about.\"
   provides (<list>)
   requires (<list>)
   size <integer-bytes>
   md5sum \"<checksum\"
   type single
   )
   ...
   ))

For version information, it is assumed things are listed in most
recent to least recent -- in other words, the version names don't have to
be lexically ordered.  It is debatable if it makes sense to have more than
one version of a package available.")

Argument INFORMATION is a symbol that can be any one of:

   standards-version     Package system version (not used).
   version               Version of the XEmacs package.
   author-version        The upstream version of the package.
   date                  The date the package was last modified.
   build-date            The date the package was last built.
   maintainer            The maintainer of the package.
   distribution          Will always be \"xemacs\" (not used).
   priority              \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\" (not used).
   category              Either \"standard\", \"mule\", or \"unsupported\"..
   dump                  Is the package dumped (not used).
   description           A description of the package.
   filename              The filename of the binary tarball of the package.
   md5sum                The md5sum of filename.
   size                  The size in bytes of filename.
   provides              A list of symbols that this package provides.
   requires              A list of packages that this package requires.
   type                  Can be either \"regular\" or \"single-file\".

If optional argument ARG is non-nil insert INFORMATION into current
buffer at point.  This is very useful for doing things like inserting
a maintainer's email address into a mail buffer.
