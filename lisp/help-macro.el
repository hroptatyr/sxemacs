;; This file supplies the macro make-help-screen which constructs
;; single character dispatching with browsable help such as that provided
;; by help-for-help. This can be used to make many modes easier to use; for
;; example, the Gnu Emacs Empire Tool uses this for every "nested" mode map
;; called from the main mode map.

;;       The name of this package was changed from help-screen.el to
;; help-macro.el in order to fit in a 14-character limit.

;;->		  "You have discovered the GEET redistribution commands
;;->   From here, you can use the following options:
;;->
;;->c	Redistribute civs from overfull sectors into connected underfull ones
;;->	  The functions typically named by empire-ideal-civ-fcn control
;;->          based in part on empire-sector-civ-threshold  
;;->m	Redistribute military using levels given by empire-ideal-mil-fcn
;;->p	Redistribute excess population to highways for max pop growth
;;->	  Excess is any sector so full babies will not be born.
;;->f	Even out food on highways to highway min and leave levels
;;->	  This is good to pump max food to all warehouses/dist pts
;;->
;;->
;;->Use \\[help-for-empire-redistribute-map] for help on redistribution.
;;->Use \\[help-for-empire-extract-map] for help on data extraction.
;;->Please use \\[describe-key] to find out more about any of the other keys."
