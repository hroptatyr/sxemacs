(defun canonicalize-spec-list (spec-list specifier-type &optional noerror)
  "Canonicalize the given SPEC-LIST (a list of specifications).

SPECIFIER-TYPE specifies the type of specifier that this SPEC-LIST
will be used for.

Canonicalizing means converting to the full form for a spec-list, i.e.
`((LOCALE (TAG-SET . INSTANTIATOR) ...) ...)'.  This function accepts
a possibly abbreviated specification or a list of such things. (See
`canonicalize-spec'.) This is the function used to convert spec-lists
accepted by `set-specifier' and such into a form suitable for
`add-spec-list-to-specifier'.

The canonicalization algorithm is as follows:

1. Attempt to parse SPEC-LIST as a single, possibly abbreviated, specification.
2. If (1) fails, attempt to parse SPEC-LIST as a list of (abbreviated)
   specifications.
3. If (2) fails, SPEC-LIST is invalid.

A possibly abbreviated specification SPEC is parsed by

1. Attempt to parse SPEC as a possibly abbreviated inst-list.
2. If (1) fails, attempt to parse SPEC as a cons of a locale and an
   (abbreviated) inst-list.
3. If (2) fails, SPEC is invalid.

A possibly abbreviated inst-list INST-LIST is parsed by

1. Attempt to parse INST-LIST as a possibly abbreviated inst-pair.
2. If (1) fails, attempt to parse INST-LIST as a list of (abbreviated)
   inst-pairs.
3. If (2) fails, INST-LIST is invalid.

A possibly abbreviated inst-pair INST-PAIR is parsed by

1. Check if INST-PAIR is `valid-instantiator-p'.
2. If not, check if INST-PAIR is a cons of something that is a tag, ie,
   `valid-specifier-tag-p', and something that is `valid-instantiator-p'.
3. If not, check if INST-PAIR is a cons of a list of tags and something that
   is `valid-instantiator-p'.

In summary, this function generally prefers more abbreviated forms.

This function tries extremely hard to resolve any ambiguities, and the
built-in specifier types (font, image, toolbar, etc.) are designed so that
there won't be any ambiguities.  (#### Unfortunately there are bugs in the
treatment of toolbar spec-lists and generic spec-lists; avoid depending on
canonicalization for these types.)

(defun set-specifier (specifier value &optional locale tag-set how-to-add)
  "Add the specification(s) given by VALUE to SPECIFIER in LOCALE.

VALUE may be any of the values accepted by `canonicalize-spec-list', including

-- an instantiator (either a Lisp object which will be returned when the
   specifier is instanced, or a Lisp object that can be instantiated to
   produce an opaque value: eg, a font name (string) can be used for a font
   specifier, but an instance will be a font object)
-- a list of instantiators
-- a cons of a locale and an instantiator, or of a locale and a list of
   instantiators
-- a cons of a tag or tag-set and an instantiator (or list of instantiators)
-- a cons of a locale and the previous type of item
-- a list of one or more of any of the previous types of items
-- a canonical spec-list.

See `canonicalize-spec-list' for details.  If you need to know the details,
though, strongly consider using the unambiguous APIs `add-spec-to-specifier'
and `add-spec-list-to-specifier' instead.

Finally, VALUE can itself be a specifier (of the same type as
SPECIFIER), if you want to copy specifications from one specifier
to another; this is equivalent to calling `copy-specifier', and
LOCALE, TAG-SET, and HOW-TO-ADD have the same semantics as with
that function.

Note that a VALUE of `nil' is either illegal or will be treated as a value of
`nil'; it does not remove existing specifications.  Use `remove-specifier' for
that.  N.B. `remove-specifier' defaults to removing all specifications, not
just the 'global one!

Warning: this function is inherently heuristic, and should not be relied on to
properly resolve ambiguities, when specifier instantiators can be lists
\(currently, for toolbar specifiers and generic specifiers).  In those cases
use either `add-spec-to-specifier' or `add-spec-list-to-specifier'.

LOCALE indicates where this specification is active, and should be
a buffer, a window, a frame, a device, or the symbol `global' to
indicate that it applies everywhere.  LOCALE defaults to
`global' if omitted, and is overridden by locales provided by VALUE (in the
cases where value is a full specification or a spec-list).

Optional argument TAG-SET is a tag or a list of tags, to be associated
with the VALUE.  Tags are symbols (usually naming device types, such
as `x' and `tty', or device classes, such as `color', `mono', and
`grayscale'); specifying a TAG-SET restricts the scope of VALUE to
devices that match all specified tags. (You can also create your
own tags using `define-specifier-tag', and use them to identify
specifications added by you, so you can remove them later.)

Optional argument HOW-TO-ADD should be either nil or one of the
symbols `prepend', `append', `remove-tag-set-prepend',
`remove-tag-set-append', `remove-locale', `remove-locale-type',
or `remove-all'.  This specifies what to do with existing
specifications in LOCALE (and possibly elsewhere in the specifier).
Most of the time, you do not need to worry about this argument;
the default behavior of `remove-tag-set-prepend' is usually fine.
See `copy-specifier' and `add-spec-to-specifier' for a full
description of what each of these means.

Note that `set-specifier' is exactly complementary to `specifier-specs'
except in the case where SPECIFIER has no specs at all in it but nil
is a valid instantiator (in that case, `specifier-specs' will return
nil (meaning no specs) and `set-specifier' will interpret the `nil'
as meaning \"I'm adding a global instantiator and its value is `nil'\"),
or in strange cases where there is an ambiguity between a spec-list
and an inst-list, etc. (The built-in specifier types are designed
in such a way as to avoid any such ambiguities.)"

SPECIFIER is the specifier to be temporarily modified.  VALUE is the
