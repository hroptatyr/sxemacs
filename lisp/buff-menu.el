;; Edit, delete, or change attributes of all currently active Emacs
;; buffers from a list summarizing their state.  A good way to browse
;; any special or scratch buffers you have loaded, since you can't find
;; them by filename.  The single entry point is `Buffer-menu-mode',
;; normally bound to C-x C-b.

;;; Change Log:

;; Merged by esr with recent mods to Emacs 19 buff-menu, 23 Mar 1993
;;
;; Modified by Bob Weiner, Motorola, Inc., 4/14/89
;;
;; Added optional backup argument to 'Buffer-menu-unmark' to make it undelete
;; current entry and then move to previous one.
;;
;; Based on FSF code dating back to 1985.

;;; Code:

;;;Trying to preserve the old window configuration works well in
;;;simple scenarios, when you enter the buffer menu, use it, and exit it.
;;;But it does strange things when you switch back to the buffer list buffer
;;;with C-x b, later on, when the window configuration is different.
;;;The choice seems to be, either restore the window configuration
;;;in all cases, or in no cases.
;;;I decided it was better not to restore the window config at all. -- rms.

;;;But since then, I changed buffer-menu to use the selected window,
;;;so q now once again goes back to the previous window configuration.

;;;(defvar Buffer-menu-window-config nil
;;;  "Window configuration saved from entry to `buffer-menu'.")

; Put buffer *Buffer List* into proper mode right away
; so that from now on even list-buffers is enough to get a buffer menu.
