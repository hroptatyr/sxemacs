;;;; Guts of minibuffer invocation

;;#### The only things remaining in C are
;; "Vminibuf_prompt" and the display junk
;;  "minibuf_prompt_width" and "minibuf_prompt_pix_width"
;; Also "active_frame", though I suspect I could already
;;   hack that in Lisp if I could make any sense of the
;;   complete mess of frame/frame code in XEmacs.
;; Vminibuf_prompt could easily be made Lisp-bindable.
;;  I suspect that minibuf_prompt*_width are actually recomputed
;;  by redisplay as needed -- or could be arranged to be so --
;;  and that there could be need for read-minibuffer-internal to
;;  save and restore them.
;;#### The only other thing which read-from-minibuffer-internal does
;;  which we can't presently do in Lisp is move the frame cursor
;;  to the start of the minibuffer line as it returns.  This is
;;  a rather nice touch and should be preserved -- probably by
;;  providing some Lisp-level mechanism (extension to cursor-in-echo-area ?)
;;  to effect it.

Fifth arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list

PROMPT is a string to prompt with; normally it ends in a colon and a space.
TABLE is an alist whose elements' cars are strings, or an obarray.
TABLE can also be a function which does the completion itself.
PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of TABLE.
See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details

If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, the user is not allowed to exit unless

HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; ("Kludgy minibuffer hackery" is perhaps a better name)

;; This works by setting `mouse-grabbed-buffer' to the minibuffer,
;; defining button2 in the minibuffer keymap to
;; `minibuffer-smart-select-highlighted-completion', and setting the
;; mode-motion-hook of the minibuffer to `minibuffer-mouse-tracker'.
;; By setting `mouse-grabbed-buffer', the minibuffer's keymap and
;; mode-motion-hook apply (for mouse motion and presses) no matter
;; what buffer the mouse is over.  Then, `minibuffer-mouse-tracker'
;; examines the text under the mouse looking for something that looks
;; like a completion, and causes it to be highlighted, and
;; `minibuffer-smart-select-highlighted-completion' looks for a
;; flagged completion under the mouse and inserts it.  This has the
;; following advantages:
;;
;; -- filenames and such in any buffer can be inserted by clicking,
;;    not just completions
;;
;; but the following disadvantages:
;;
;; -- unless you're aware of the "filename in any buffer" feature,
;;    the fact that strings in arbitrary buffers get highlighted appears
;;    as a bug
;; -- mouse motion can cause ange-ftp actions -- bad bad bad.
;;
;; There's some hackery in minibuffer-mouse-tracker to try to avoid the
;; ange-ftp stuff, but it doesn't work.
;;

  "*If non-nil, look for completions under mouse in all buffers.

This is not enabled by default because

-- The \"mysterious\" highlighting in normal buffers is confusing to
   people not expecting it, and looks like a bug
-- If ange-ftp is enabled, this tracking sometimes causes ange-ftp
   action as a result of mouse motion, which is *bad bad bad*.
