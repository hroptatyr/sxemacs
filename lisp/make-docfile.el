;;; Commentary:

;; This is a front-end to the make-docfile program that gathers up all the
;; lisp files that will be dumped with XEmacs.  It would probably be best
;; to just move make-docfile.c completely to lisp and be done with it.

;;; SXEmacs Note: When we moved to a libtool based build chain, I had
;;; to remove all the #'princ calls here otherwise `make DOC' just
;;; gives a zero length DOC file.  I doubt that this is a good or even
;;; real fix. --SY.
