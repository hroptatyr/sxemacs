;; Commentary:

;; This file is dumped with SXEmacs.

;; Easymenu allows you to define menus for both Emacs 19 and XEmacs.

;; This file
;; The advantages of using easymenu are:

;; - Easier to use than either the Emacs 19 and XEmacs menu syntax.

;; - Common interface for Emacs 18, Emacs 19, and XEmacs.
;;   (The code does nothing when run under Emacs 18).

;; The public functions are:

;; - Function: easy-menu-define SYMBOL MAPS DOC MENU
;;     SYMBOL is both the name of the variable that holds the menu and
;;            the name of a function that will present the menu.
;;     MAPS is a list of keymaps where the menu should appear in the menubar.
;;     DOC is the documentation string for the variable.
;;     MENU is an XEmacs style menu description.

;;     See the documentation for easy-menu-define for details.

;; - Function: easy-menu-change PATH NAME ITEMS
;;     Change an existing menu.
;;     The menu must already exist and be visible on the menu bar.
;;     PATH is a list of strings used for locating the menu on the menu bar.
;;     NAME is the name of the menu.
;;     ITEMS is a list of menu items, as defined in `easy-menu-define'.

;; - Function: easy-menu-add MENU [ MAP ]
;;     Add MENU to the current menubar in MAP.

;; - Function: easy-menu-remove MENU
;;     Remove MENU from the current menubar.

;; - Function: easy-menu-add-item
;;     Add item or submenu to existing menu

;; - Function: easy-menu-item-present-p
;;     Locate item

;; - Function: easy-menu-remove-item
;;     Delete item from menu.

;; Emacs 19 never uses `easy-menu-add' or `easy-menu-remove', menus
;; automatically appear and disappear when the keymaps specified by
;; the MAPS argument to `easy-menu-define' are activated.

;; XEmacs will bind the map to button3 in each MAPS, but you must
;; explicitly call `easy-menu-add' and `easy-menu-remove' to add and
;; remove menus from the menu bar.

;;; Code:

;; ;;;###autoload
(defmacro easy-menu-define (symbol maps doc menu)
  "Define a menu bar submenu in maps MAPS, according to MENU.
The arguments SYMBOL and DOC are ignored; they are present for
compatibility only.  SYMBOL is not evaluated.  In other Emacs versions
these arguments may be used as a variable to hold the menu data, and a
doc string for that variable.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
The rest of the elements are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form:

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ] ... ]

Where KEYWORD is one of the symbol defined below.

   :keys KEYS

KEYS is a string; a complex keyboard equivalent to this menu item.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :suffix NAME

NAME is a string; the name of an argument to CALLBACK.

   :style STYLE

STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item.  The following are
defined:

toggle: A checkbox.
        Currently just prepend the name with the string \"Toggle \".
radio: A radio button.
nil: An ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.
Currently just disable radio buttons, no effect on checkboxes.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list.  It is treated as a submenu.
The first element should be the submenu name.  That's used as the
menu item in the top-level menu.  The cdr of the submenu list
is a list of menu items, as above."
