;; This file is dumped with SXEmacs.

;; These functions exploit the load-history system variable.
;; Entry points include `unload-feature', `symbol-file', and `feature-file'.

;;; Code:

;; load-history is a list of entries that look like this:
;; ("outline" outline-regexp ... (require . wid-edit) ... (provide . outline) ...)
