  "Alist to decide a coding system to use for a process I/O operation.
The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),
where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a program name,
VAL is a coding system, a cons of coding systems, or a function symbol.
If VAL is a coding system, it is used for both decoding what received
from the program and encoding what sent to the program.
If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,
and the cdr part is used for encoding.
If VAL is a function symbol, the function must return a coding system
or a cons of coding systems which are used as above.")

  "Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.
The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
Insert output in BUFFER before point; t means current buffer;
 nil for BUFFER means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait.
BUFFER can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.

Fourth arg DISPLAYP non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.

If BUFFER is 0, `call-process' returns immediately with value nil.
Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate and returns a numeric exit status
 or a signal description string.
If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you
 quit again.

Coding systems are taken from `coding-system-for-read' for input and
`coding-system-for-write' for output if those variables are bound.
Otherwise they are looked up in `process-coding-system-alist'.  If not
found, they default to `nil' for both input and output."

NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify

Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.
Fourth arg SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an integer
 specifying a port number to connect to.
Fifth argument PROTOCOL is a network protocol.  Currently 'tcp
 (Transmission Control Protocol) and 'udp (User Datagram Protocol) are
 supported.  When omitted, 'tcp is assumed.

Output via `process-send-string' and input via buffer or filter (see
`set-process-filter') are stream-oriented.  That means UDP datagrams are
not guaranteed to be sent and received in discrete packets. (But small
datagrams around 500 bytes that are not truncated by `process-send-string'
are usually fine.)  Note further that UDP protocol does not guard against 
lost packets."
