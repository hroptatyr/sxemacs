  "Generalized mouse-button handler.  This should be bound to a mouse button.
The behavior of this function is customizable using various hooks and
variables: see `mouse-track-click-hook', `mouse-track-drag-hook',
`mouse-track-drag-up-hook', `mouse-track-down-hook', `mouse-track-up-hook',
`mouse-track-cleanup-hook', `mouse-track-multi-click-time',
`mouse-track-scroll-delay', `mouse-track-x-threshold', and
`mouse-track-y-threshold'.

Default handlers are provided to implement standard selecting/positioning
behavior.  You can explicitly request this default behavior, and override
any custom-supplied handlers, by using the function `mouse-track-default'
instead of `mouse-track'.

\(In general, you can override specific hooks by using the argument
OVERRIDING-HOOKS, which should be a plist of alternating hook names
and values.)

Default behavior is as follows:

If you click-and-drag, the selection will be set to the region between the
point of the initial click and the point at which you release the button.
These positions need not be ordered.

If you click-and-release without moving the mouse, then the point is moved
and the selection is disowned (there will be no selection owner).  The mark
will be set to the previous position of point.

If you double-click, the selection will extend by symbols instead of by
characters.  If you triple-click, the selection will extend by lines.

If you drag the mouse off the top or bottom of the window, you can select
pieces of text which are larger than the visible part of the buffer; the
buffer will scroll as necessary.

The selected text becomes the current X Selection.  The point will be left
