;;; Code:

(defun quit-char (&optional console)
  "Return the character that causes a QUIT to happen.
This is normally C-g.  Optional arg CONSOLE specifies the console
that the information is returned for; nil means the current console."
  (nth 3 (current-input-mode console)))

(defun resume-pid-console (pid)
  "Resume the consoles with a controlling process of PID."
  (mapc (lambda (c) 
	  (if (and (eq (console-type c) 'tty)
		   (eql pid (console-tty-controlling-process c)))
	      (resume-console c)))
	(console-list))
  nil)
