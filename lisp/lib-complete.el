;; Many thanks to Hallvard Furuseth <hallvard@ifi.uio.no> for his
;; helpful suggestions.

;; The function locate-file is removed, because of its incompatibility
;; with the buildin function of the lemacs 19.10 (Heiko M|nkel).

;; There is now the new function find-library in this package.

;;; ChangeLog:

;; 4/26/97: sb Mule-ize.
;; 6/24/1999 much rewriting from Bob Weiner
