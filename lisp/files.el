This command also refreshes certain special buffers that contain text
which doesn't come from a file, but reflects some other data base
instead: for example, Dired buffers and buffer-list buffers.  This is
implemented by having the modes set `revert-buffer-function'.

When called from Lisp, the first argument is IGNORE-AUTO; only offer
to revert from the auto-save file when this is nil.  Note that the
sense of this argument is the reverse of the prefix argument, for the
sake of backward compatibility.  IGNORE-AUTO is optional, defaulting
to nil.

Optional second argument NOCONFIRM means don't ask for confirmation at

Optional third argument PRESERVE-MODES non-nil means don't alter
the buffer's modes.  Otherwise, reinitialize them using `normal-mode'.

If the value of `revert-buffer-function' is non-nil, it is called to
do all the work for this command.  Otherwise, the hooks
`before-revert-hook' and `after-revert-hook' are run at the beginning
and the end, and if `revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function' is
