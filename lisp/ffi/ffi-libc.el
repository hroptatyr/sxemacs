The argument MODE is a string beginning with one of the following

``r+''  Open for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the
        beginning of the file.

``w''   Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.
        The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

``w+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
        exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream is positioned at
        the beginning of the file.

``a''   Open for writing.  The file is created if it does not exist.  The
        stream is positioned at the end of the file.  Subsequent writes
        to the file will always end up at the then current end of file,

``a+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
        exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.  Subse-
        quent writes to the file will always end up at the then current

The mode string can also include the letter ``b'' either as a third char-
acter or as a character between the characters in any of the two-charac-
ter strings described above.  This is strictly for compatibility with
ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (``ISO C90'') and has no effect; the ``b'' is ignored."
