;; This file contains the device-nospecific font menu stuff

;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Creates three menus, "Font", "Size", and "Weight", and puts them on the
;;; "Options" menu.  The contents of these menus are the superset of those
;;; properties available on any fonts, but only the intersection of the three
;;; sets is selectable at one time.
;;;
;;; Known Problems:
;;; ===============
;;; Items on the Font menu are selectable if and only if that font exists in
;;; the same size and weight as the current font.  This means that some fonts
;;; are simply not reachable from some other fonts - if only one font comes
;;; in only one point size (like "Nil", which comes only in 2), you will never
;;; be able to select it.  It would be better if the items on the Fonts menu
;;; were always selectable, and selecting them would set the size to be the
;;; closest size to the current font's size.
;;;
;;; This attempts to change all other faces in an analogous way to the change
;;; that was made to the default face; if it can't, it will skip over the face.
;;; However, this could leave incongruous font sizes around, which may cause
;;; some nonreversibility problems if further changes are made.  Perhaps it
;;; should remember the initial fonts of all faces, and derive all subsequent
;;; fonts from that initial state.
;;;
;;; xfontsel(1) is a lot more flexible (but probably harder to understand).
;;;
;;; The code to construct menus from all of the x11 fonts available from the
;;; server is autoloaded and executed the very first time that one of the Font
;;; menus is selected on each device.  That is, if XEmacs has frames on two
;;; different devices, then separate font menu information will be maintained
;;; for each X display.  If the font path changes after emacs has already
;;; asked the X server on a particular display for its list of fonts, this
;;; won't notice.  Also, the first time that a font menu is posted on each
;;; display will entail a lengthy delay, but that's better than slowing down
;;; XEmacs startup.  At any time (i.e.: after a font-path change or
;;; immediately after device creation), you can call
;;; `reset-device-font-menus' to rebuild the menus from all currently
;;; available fonts.
;;;
;;; There are at least three kinds of fonts under X11r5:
;;;
;;; - bitmap fonts, which can be assumed to look as good as possible;
;;; - bitmap fonts which have been (or can be) automatically scaled to
;;;   a new size, and which almost always look awful;
;;; - and true outline fonts, which should look ok at any size, but in
;;;   practice (on at least some systems) look awful at any size, and
;;;   even in theory are unlikely ever to look as good as non-scaled
;;;   bitmap fonts.
;;;
;;; It would be nice to get this code to look for non-scaled bitmap fonts
;;; first, then outline fonts, then scaled bitmap fonts as a last resort.
;;; But it's not clear to me how to tell them apart based on their truenames
;;; and/or the result of XListFonts().  I welcome any and all explanations
;;; of the subtleties involved...
;;;
;;;
;;; If You Think You'Re Seeing A Bug:
;;; =================================
;;; When reporting problems, send the following information:
;;;
;;; - Exactly what behavior you're seeing;
;;; - The output of the `xlsfonts' program;
;;; - The value of the variable `device-fonts-cache';
;;; - The values of the following expressions, both before and after
;;;   making a selection from any of the fonts-related menus:
;;;	(face-font 'default)
;;;	(font-truename   (face-font 'default))
;;;	(font-properties (face-font 'default))
;;; - The values of the following variables after making a selection:
;;;	font-menu-preferred-resolution
;;;	font-menu-registry-encoding
;;;
;;; There is a common misconception that "*-courier-medium-r-*-11-*", also
;;; known as "-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--11-80-100-100-m-60-iso8859-1",
;;; is an 11-point font.  It is not -- it is an 11-pixel font at 100dpi,
;;; which is an 8-point font (the number after -11- is the size in tenths
;;; of points).  So if you expect to be seeing an "11" entry in the "Size"
;;; menu and are not, this may be why.
;;;
;;; In the real world (aka Solaris), one has to deal with fonts that
;;; appear to be medium-i but are really light-r, and fonts that
;;; resolve to different resolutions depending on the charset:
;;;
;;; (font-instance-truename
;;;  (make-font-instance "-*-mincho-medium-i-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0201*-*"))
;;; ==>
;;; "-morisawa-ryumin light kl-light-r-normal--10-100-72-72-m-50-jisx0201.1976-0"
;;;
;;; (list-fonts "-dt-interface user-medium-r-normal-s*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")
;;; ==>
;;; ("-dt-interface user-medium-r-normal-s sans-12-120-72-72-m-70-iso8859-1"
;;;  "-dt-interface user-medium-r-normal-s-14-120-75-75-m-120-jisx0208.1983-0"
