  "Return FACE's value of the given PROPERTY.

If LOCALE is omitted, the FACE's actual value for PROPERTY will be
  returned.  For built-in properties, this will be a specifier object
  of a type appropriate to the property (e.g. a font or color
  specifier).  For other properties, this could be anything.

If LOCALE is supplied, then instead of returning the actual value,
  the specification(s) for the given locale or locale type will
  be returned.  This will only work if the actual value of
  PROPERTY is a specifier (this will always be the case for built-in
  properties, but not or not may apply to user-defined properties).
  If the actual value of PROPERTY is not a specifier, this value
  will simply be returned regardless of LOCALE.

The return value will be a list of instantiators (e.g. strings
  specifying a font or color name), or a list of specifications, each
  of which is a cons of a locale and a list of instantiators.
  Specifically, if LOCALE is a particular locale (a buffer, window,
  frame, device, or 'global), a list of instantiators for that locale
  will be returned.  Otherwise, if LOCALE is a locale type (one of
  the symbols 'buffer, 'window, 'frame, or 'device), the specifications
  for all locales of that type will be returned.  Finally, if LOCALE is
  'all, the specifications for all locales of all types will be returned.

The specifications in a specifier determine what the value of
  PROPERTY will be in a particular \"domain\" or set of circumstances,
  which is typically a particular Emacs window along with the buffer
  it contains and the frame and device it lies within.  The value is
  derived from the instantiator associated with the most specific
  locale (in the order buffer, window, frame, device, and 'global)
  that matches the domain in question.  In other words, given a domain
  (i.e. an Emacs window, usually), the specifier for PROPERTY will
  first be searched for a specification whose locale is the buffer
  contained within that window; then for a specification whose locale
  is the window itself; then for a specification whose locale is the
  frame that the window is contained within; etc.  The first
  instantiator that is valid for the domain (usually this means that
  the instantiator is recognized by the device [i.e. MS Windows, the X
  server or TTY device] that the domain is on.  The function
  `face-property-instance' actually does all this, and is used to
  determine how to display the face.

See `set-face-property' for the built-in property-names."

(defun face-property-instance (face property

  "Return the instance of FACE's PROPERTY in the specified DOMAIN.

Under most circumstances, DOMAIN will be a particular window,
  and the returned instance describes how the specified property
  actually is displayed for that window and the particular buffer
  in it.  Note that this may not be the same as how the property
  appears when the buffer is displayed in a different window or
  frame, or how the property appears in the same window if you
  switch to another buffer in that window; and in those cases,
  the returned instance would be different.

The returned instance will typically be a color-instance,
  font-instance, or pixmap-instance object, and you can query
  it using the appropriate object-specific functions.  For example,
  you could use `color-instance-rgb-components' to find out the
  RGB (red, green, and blue) components of how the 'background
  property of the 'highlight face is displayed in a particular
  window.  The results might be different from the results
  you would get for another window (perhaps the user
  specified a different color for the frame that window is on;
  or perhaps the same color was specified but the window is
  on a different X server, and that X server has different RGB
  values for the color from this one).

DOMAIN defaults to the selected window if omitted.

DOMAIN can be a frame or device, instead of a window.  The value
  returned for a such a domain is used in special circumstances
  when a more specific domain does not apply; for example, a frame
  value might be used for coloring a toolbar, which is conceptually
  attached to a frame rather than a particular window.  The value
  is also useful in determining what the value would be for a
  particular window within the frame or device, if it is not
  overridden by a more specific specification.

If PROPERTY does not name a built-in property, its value will
  simply be returned unless it is a specifier object, in which case
  it will be instanced using `specifier-instance'.

Optional arguments DEFAULT and NO-FALLBACK are the same as in
  `specifier-instance'."

			       how-to-add)
  "Change a property of FACE.

NOTE: If you want to remove a property from a face, use `remove-face-property'
  rather than attempting to set a value of nil for the property.

For built-in properties, the actual value of the property is a
  specifier and you cannot change this; but you can change the
  specifications within the specifier, and that is what this function
  will do.  For user-defined properties, you can use this function
  to either change the actual value of the property or, if this value
  is a specifier, change the specifications within it.

If PROPERTY is a built-in property, the specifications to be added to
  this property can be supplied in many different ways:

  -- If VALUE is a simple instantiator (e.g. a string naming a font or
     color) or a list of instantiators, then the instantiator(s) will
     be added as a specification of the property for the given LOCALE
     (which defaults to 'global if omitted).
  -- If VALUE is a list of specifications (each of which is a cons of
     a locale and a list of instantiators), then LOCALE must be nil
     (it does not make sense to explicitly specify a locale in this
     case), and specifications will be added as given.
  -- If VALUE is a specifier (as would be returned by `face-property'
     if no LOCALE argument is given), then some or all of the
     specifications in the specifier will be added to the property.
     In this case, the function is really equivalent to
     `copy-specifier' and LOCALE has the same semantics (if it is
     a particular locale, the specification for the locale will be
     copied; if a locale type, specifications for all locales of
     that type will be copied; if nil or 'all, then all
     specifications will be copied).

HOW-TO-ADD should be either nil or one of the symbols 'prepend,
  'append, 'remove-tag-set-prepend, 'remove-tag-set-append, 'remove-locale,
  'remove-locale-type, or 'remove-all.  See `copy-specifier' and
  `add-spec-to-specifier' for a description of what each of
  these means.  Most of the time, you do not need to worry about
  this argument; the default behavior usually is fine.

In general, it is OK to pass an instance object (e.g. as returned
  by `face-property-instance') as an instantiator in place of
  an actual instantiator.  In such a case, the instantiator used
  to create that instance object will be used (for example, if
  you set a font-instance object as the value of the 'font
  property, then the font name used to create that object will
  be used instead).  If some cases, however, doing this
  conversion does not make sense, and this will be noted in
  the documentation for particular types of instance objects.

If PROPERTY is not a built-in property, then this function will
  simply set its value if LOCALE is nil.  However, if LOCALE is
  given, then this function will attempt to add VALUE as the
  instantiator for the given LOCALE, using `add-spec-to-specifier'.
  If the value of the property is not a specifier, it will
  automatically be converted into a 'generic specifier.

This function is ugly and messy and is primarily used as an internal

FUNC should be a function of two arguments (an instance and a device)
that returns a modified name that is valid for the given device.
If LOCALE specifies a valid domain (i.e. a window, frame, or device),
this function instantiates the specifier over that domain, applies FUNC
to the resulting instance, and adds the result back as an instantiator
for that locale.  Otherwise, LOCALE should be a locale, locale type, or
'all (defaults to 'all if omitted).  For each specification thusly
included: if the locale given is a valid domain, FUNC will be
iterated over all valid instantiators for the device of the domain
until a non-nil result is found (if there is no such result, the
first valid instantiator is used), and that result substituted for
the specification; otherwise, the process just outlined is
iterated over each existing device and the concatenated results
substituted for the specification.

This will attempt to make the font bold for X locales and will set the

If LOCALE is nil, omitted, or `all', this will attempt to frob all
font specifications for FACE to make them appear bold.  Similarly, if
LOCALE is a locale type, this frobs all font specifications for locales
of that type.  If LOCALE is a particular locale, what happens depends on
what sort of locale is given.  If you gave a device, frame, or window,
then it's always possible to determine what the font actually will be,
so this is determined and the resulting font is frobbed and added back as a
specification for this locale.  If LOCALE is a buffer, however, you can't
determine what the font will actually be unless there's actually a
specification given for that particular buffer (otherwise, it depends
on what window and frame the buffer appears in, and might not even be
well-defined if the buffer appears multiple times in different places);
therefore you will get an error unless there's a specification for the
buffer.

Finally, in some cases (specifically, when LOCALE is not a locale type),
if the frobbing didn't actually make the font look any different
\(this happens, for example, if your font specification is already bold
or has no bold equivalent), and currently looks like the font of the
'default face, it is set to inherit from the 'bold face.  This is kludgy
