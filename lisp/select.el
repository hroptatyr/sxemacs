The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection,

that can be converted using the function corresponding to DATA-TYPE
in `select-converter-alist'---strings are the usual choice, but
other types may be permissible depending on the DATA-TYPE parameter
(if DATA-TYPE is not supplied, the default behavior is window
system specific, but strings are always accepted).
HOW-TO-ADD may be any of the following:

  'replace-all or nil -- replace all data in the selection.
  'replace-existing   -- replace data for specified DATA-TYPE only.
  'append or t        -- append data to existing DATA-TYPE data.

DATA-TYPE is the window-system specific data type identifier
(see `register-selection-data-type' for more information).

The selection may also be a cons of two markers pointing to the same buffer,
or an overlay.  In these cases, the selection is considered to be the text
between the markers *at whatever time the selection is examined* (note
that the window system clipboard does not necessarily duplicate this
behavior).
Thus, editing done in the buffer after you specify the selection
can alter the effective value of the selection.

The data may also be a vector of valid non-vector selection values.

Interactively, the text of the region is used as the selection value."
