;;; Synched up with: Not in FSF.

;;; Commentary:

;; Gnuserv is run when Emacs needs to operate as a server for other
;; processes.  Specifically, any number of files can be attached for
;; editing to a running XEmacs process using the `gnuclient' program.

;; Use `M-x gnuserv-start' to start the server and `gnuclient files'
;; to load them to XEmacs.  When you are done with a buffer, press
;; `C-x #' (`M-x gnuserv-edit').  You can put (gnuserv-start) to your
;; .emacs, and enable `gnuclient' as your Unix "editor".  When all the
;; buffers for a client have been edited and exited with
;; `gnuserv-edit', the client "editor" will return to the program that
;; invoked it.

;; Your editing commands and Emacs' display output go to and from the
;; terminal or X display in the usual way.  If you are running under
;; X, a new X frame will be open for each gnuclient.  If you are on a
;; TTY, this TTY will be attached as a new device to the running
;; XEmacs, and will be removed once you are done with the buffer.

;; To evaluate a Lisp form in a running Emacs, use the `-eval'
;; argument of gnuclient.  To simplify this, we provide the `gnudoit'
;; shell script.  For example `gnudoit "(+ 2 3)"' will print `5',
;; whereas `gnudoit "(gnus)"' will fire up your favorite newsreader.
;; Like gnuclient, `gnudoit' requires the server to be started prior
;; to using it.

;; For more information you can refer to man pages of gnuclient,
;; gnudoit and gnuserv, distributed with XEmacs.

;; gnuserv.el was originally written by Andy Norman as an improvement
;; over William Sommerfeld's server.el.  Since then, a number of
;; people have worked on it, including Bob Weiner, Darell Kindred,
;; Arup Mukherjee, Ben Wing and Jan Vroonhof.  It was completely
;; rewritten (labeled as version 3) by Hrvoje Niksic in May 1997.  The
;; new code will not run on GNU Emacs.

;; Jan Vroonhof <vroonhof@math.ethz.ch> July/1996
;; ported the server-temp-file-regexp feature from server.el
;; ported server hooks from server.el
;; ported kill-*-query functions from server.el (and made it optional)
;; synced other behavior with server.el
;;
;; Jan Vroonhof
;;     Customized.
;;
;; Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org> May/1997
;;     Completely rewritten.  Now uses `defstruct' and other CL stuff
;;     to define clients cleanly.  Many thanks to Dave Gillespie!
;;
;; Mike Scheidler <c23mts@eng.delcoelect.com> July, 1997
;;     Added 'Done' button to the menubar.
