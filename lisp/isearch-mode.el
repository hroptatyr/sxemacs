;;; Commentary:

;; Instructions

;; Searching with isearch-mode.el should work just like isearch.el
;; [the one from Emacs 18], except it is done in a temporary minor
;; mode that terminates when you finish searching.

;; For programmed use of isearch-mode, e.g. calling (isearch-forward),
;; isearch-mode behaves modally and does not return until the search
;; is completed.  It uses a recursive-edit to behave this way.  In
;; that case, you should still be able switch buffers, so be careful
;; not to get things confused.

;; The key bindings active within isearch-mode are defined below in
;; `isearch-mode-map' which is given bindings close to the default
;; characters of the original isearch.el.  With `isearch-mode',
;; however, you can bind multi-character keys and it should be easier
;; to add new commands.  One bug though: keys with meta-prefix cannot
;; be longer than two chars.  Also see minibuffer-local-isearch-map
;; for bindings active during `isearch-edit-string'.

;; The search ring and completion commands automatically put you in
;; the minibuffer to edit the string.  This gives you a chance to
;; modify the search string before executing the search.  There are
;; three commands to terminate the editing: C-s and C-r exit the
;; minibuffer and search forward and reverse respectively, while C-m
;; exits and does a nonincremental search.

;; Exiting immediately from isearch uses isearch-edit-string instead
;; of nonincremental-search, if search-nonincremental-instead is non-nil.
;; The name of this option should probably be changed if we decide to
;; keep the behavior.  No point in forcing nonincremental search until
;; the last possible moment.

;; TODO
;; - Integrate generalized command history to isearch-edit-string.
;; - Think about incorporating query-replace.
;; - Hooks and options for failed search.

;;; Change Log:

;; Changes before those recorded in ChangeLog:

;; 20-aug-92  Hacked by jwz for Lucid Emacs 19.3.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  92/06/29  13:10:08  liberte
;; Moved modal isearch-mode handling into isearch-mode.
;; Got rid of buffer-local isearch variables.
;; isearch-edit-string used by ring adjustments, completion, and
;; nonincremental searching.  C-s and C-r are additional exit commands.
;; Renamed all regex to regexp.
;; Got rid of found-start and found-point globals.
;; Generalized handling of upper-case chars.

;; Revision 1.2  92/05/27  11:33:57  liberte
;; Emacs version 19 has a search ring, which is supported here.
;; Other fixes found in the version 19 isearch are included here.
;;
;; Also see variables search-caps-disable-folding,
;; search-nonincremental-instead, search-whitespace-regexp, and
;; commands isearch-toggle-regexp, isearch-edit-string.
;;
;; semi-modal isearching is supported.

;; Changes for 1.1
;; 3/18/92 Fixed invalid-regexp.
;; 3/18/92 Fixed yanking in regexps.

;;; Advanced highlighting

;; When active, *every* visible match for the current search string is
;; highlighted: the current one using the normal isearch match color
;; and all the others using the `isearch-secondary' face.  The extra
;; highlighting makes it easier to anticipate where the cursor will
;; land each time you press C-s or C-r to repeat a pending search.
;; Only the matches visible at any point are highlighted -- when you
;; move through the buffer, the highlighting is readjusted.

;; This is based on ideas from Bob Glickstein's `ishl' package.  It
;; has been merged with XEmacs by Darryl Okahata, and then completely
;; rewritten by Hrvoje Niksic.

;; The code makes the following assumptions about the rest of this
;; file, so be careful when modifying it.

;; * `isearch-highlight-all-update' should get called when the search
;;   string changes, or when the search advances.  This is done from
;;   `isearch-update'.
;; * `isearch-highlight-all-cleanup' should get called when the search
;;   is done.  This is performed in `isearch-done'.
;; * `isearch-string' is expected to contain the current search string
;;   as entered by the user.
;; * `isearch-opoint' is expected to contain the location where the
;;   current search began.
;; * the type of the current search is expected to be given by
;;   `isearch-word' and `isearch-regexp'.
;; * the variable `isearch-invalid-regexp' is expected to be true iff
;;   `isearch-string' is an invalid regexp.
