 * Each dynamically loaded Emacs module is given a name at compile

 * identifier.  This name is used to construct the name of several
 * functions which must appear in the module source code.
 * The first such function, modules_of_XXXX, should load in any dependent
 * modules. This function is optional, and the module will still load if
 * it is not present in the module.
 *
 * The second function, which is NOT optional, is syms_of_XXXX, in which
 * all functions that the module will be provided are declared. This
 * function will contain calls to DEFSUBR().
 *
 * The third function, which is also NOT optional, is vars_of_XXXX, in
 * which you declare all variables that the module provides. This
 * function will contain calls to DEFVAR_LISP(), DEFVAR_BOOL() etc.
 *
 * When declaring functions and variables in the syms_of_XXXX and
 * vars_of_XXXX functions, you use the exact same syntax that you
 * would as if this module were being compiled into the pure Emacs.
 *
 * All three of these functions are declared as void functions,
 * taking no parameters. Since this sample module is called 'sample',
 * the functions will be named 'modules_of_sample', 'syms_of_sample'
 * and 'vars_of_sample'.
