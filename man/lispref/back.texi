@quotation
  Most of the SXEmacs text editor is written in the programming
language called SXEmacs Lisp.  You can write new code in SXEmacs Lisp and
install it as an extension to the editor.  However, SXEmacs Lisp is more
than a mere ``extension language''; it is a full computer programming
language in its own right.  You can use it as you would any other
programming language.

  Because SXEmacs Lisp is designed for use in an editor, it has special
features for scanning and parsing text as well as features for handling
files, buffers, displays, subprocesses, and so on.  SXEmacs Lisp is
closely integrated with the editing facilities; thus, editing commands
are functions that can also conveniently be called from Lisp programs,
and parameters for customization are ordinary Lisp variables.

  This manual describes SXEmacs Lisp.  Generally speaking, the earlier
chapters describe features of SXEmacs Lisp that have counterparts in
many programming languages, and later chapters describe features that
are peculiar to SXEmacs Lisp or relate specifically to editing.
