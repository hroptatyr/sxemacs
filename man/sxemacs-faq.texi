Learning XEmacs is a lifelong activity.  Even people who have used Emacs
for years keep discovering new features.  Therefore this document cannot
be complete.  Instead it is aimed at the person who is either
considering XEmacs for their own use, or has just obtained it and is
wondering what to do next.  It is also useful as a reference to
available resources.

The previous maintainer of the FAQ was @email{rossini@@biostat.washington.edu,
Anthony Rossini}, who started it, after getting tired of hearing JWZ
complain about repeatedly having to answer questions.
@email{ben@@xemacs.org, Ben Wing} and @email{cthomp@@xemacs.org, Chuck
Thompson}, the principal authors of XEmacs, then took over and Ben did
a massive update reorganizing the whole thing.  At which point Anthony
took back over, but then had to give it up again.  Some of the other
contributors to this FAQ are listed later in this document.

The previous version was converted to hypertext format, and edited by
@email{steve@@xemacs.org, Steven L. Baur}.  It was converted back to
texinfo by @email{hniksic@@xemacs.org, Hrvoje Niksic}.  The FAQ was then
maintained by @email{andreas@@sccon.com, Andreas Kaempf}, who passed it
on to ChristianNyb@o{}.

If you notice any errors or items which should be added or amended to

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.1: What is XEmacs?


XEmacs is a powerful, highly customizable open source text editor and
application development system, with full GUI support.  It is protected
under the GNU Public License and related to other versions of Emacs, in
particular GNU Emacs.  Its emphasis is on modern graphical user
interface support and an open software development model, similar to
Linux.  XEmacs has an active development community numbering in the
hundreds (and thousands of active beta testers on top of this), and runs
on all versions of MS Windows, on Linux, and on nearly every other
version of Unix in existence.  Support for XEmacs has been supplied by
Sun Microsystems, University of Illinois, Lucid, ETL/Electrotechnical
Laboratory, Amdahl Corporation, BeOpen, and others, as well as the
unpaid time of a great number of individual developers.

@node Q1.0.2, Q1.0.3, Q1.0.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.2: What is the current version of XEmacs?

XEmacs versions 21.1.* are releases made from the current stable
sources.  XEmacs versions 21.2.* are releases made from the development
sources.  Check at @uref{http://www.xemacs.org} for the current minor
version.

XEmacs 19.16 was the last release of v19, released in November, 1997,
which was also the last version without international language support.

@node Q1.0.3, Q1.0.4, Q1.0.2, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.3: Where can I find it?

The canonical source and binaries can be found via anonymous FTP at:

XEmacs and a detailed history of XEmacs, check out the
@example
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html, NEWS file}
@end example

However, here is a list of some of the reasons why we think you might
consider using it:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It looks nicer.

@item
The XEmacs maintainers are generally more receptive to suggestions than
the GNU Emacs maintainers.

@item
Many more bundled packages than GNU Emacs.

@item
Binaries are available for many common operating systems.

@item
Face support on TTY's.

@item
A built-in toolbar.

@item
Better Motif compliance.

@item
Some internationalization support (including full MULE support, if
compiled with it).

@item
Variable-width fonts.

@item
Variable-height lines.

@item
Marginal annotations.

@item
ToolTalk support.

@item
XEmacs can be used as an Xt widget, and can be embedded within another
application.

@item
Horizontal and vertical scrollbars (using real toolkit scrollbars).

@item
Better APIs (and performance) for attaching fonts, colors, and other
properties to text.

@item
The ability to embed arbitrary graphics in a buffer.

@item
Completely compatible (at the C level) with the Xt-based toolkits.

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.5: Why Haven't XEmacs and GNU Emacs Merged?

There are currently irreconcilable differences in the views about
technical, programming, design and organizational matters between RMS
and the XEmacs development team which provide little hope for a merge to
take place in the short-term future.

If you have a comment to add regarding the merge, it is a good idea to
avoid posting to the newsgroups,  because of the very heated flamewars
that often result.  Mail your questions to @email{xemacs-beta@@xemacs.org} and

@node Q1.0.6, Q1.0.7, Q1.0.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.0.6: Where can I get help?

Probably the easiest way, if everything is installed, is to use Info, by
pressing @kbd{C-h i}, or looking for an Info item on the
Help Menu.  @kbd{M-x apropos} can be used to look for particular commands.

@c mainstream distribution.
@c
@c For the MacOS, there is a port of

Yes.

XEmacs 21.5 (perhaps 21.4 also?) works on MacOS X, although it certainly
will not feel very much like a Mac application as it has no Mac-specific
code in it.

There is also a port of XEmacs 19.14 that works on all recent versions
of MacOS, from 8.1 through MacOS X, by @email{pjarvis@@ispchannel.com,
Pitts Jarvis}.  It runs in an equivalent of TTY mode only (one single

@unnumberedsec 1.3: Internationalization
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.1: What is the status of internationalization support aka MULE (including Asian language support?

Both the stable and development versions of XEmacs include
internationalization support (aka MULE).  MULE currently (21.4) works on
UNIX and Linux systems.  It is possible to build with MULE on Windows
systems, but if you really need MULE on Windows, it is recommended that
you build and use the development (21.5) version, and deal with the
instability of the development tree.  Binaries compiled without MULE
support run faster than MULE capable XEmacsen.

@node Q1.3.2, Q1.3.3, Q1.3.1, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.2: How can I help with internationalization?

If you would like to help, you may want to join the

people who speak/write languages other than English, who are willing to
use XEmacs/MULE regularly, and have some experience with Elisp.

Translations of the TUTORIAL and man page are welcome, and XEmacs does
support multilingual menus, but we have few current translations.

@node Q1.3.3, Q1.3.4, Q1.3.2, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.3: How do I type non-ASCII characters?

See question 3.5.7 (@pxref{Q3.5.7}) in part 3 of this FAQ for some
simple methods that also work in non-MULE builds of XEmacs (but only for
one-octet coded character sets, and mostly for ISO 8859/1).  Many of the
methods available for Cyrillic (@pxref{Q1.3.7}) work without MULE.
MULE has more general capabilities.  @xref{Q1.3.5}.

@node Q1.3.4, Q1.3.5, Q1.3.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.4: Can XEmacs messages come out in a different language?

The message-catalog support was written but is badly bit-rotted.  XEmacs
20 and 21 did @emph{not} support it, and early releases of XEmacs 22
will not either.

However, menubar localization @emph{does} work.  To enable it, add to
your @file{Emacs} file entries like this:

@example
Emacs*XlwMenu.resourceLabels:                   True
Emacs*XlwMenu.file.labelString:                 Fichier
Emacs*XlwMenu.openInOtherWindow.labelString: 	In anderem Fenster oeffnen
@end example

The name of the resource is derived from the non-localized entry by
removing punctuation and capitalizing as above.

@node Q1.3.5, Q1.3.6, Q1.3.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.5: Please explain the various input methods in MULE/XEmacs

Mule supports a wide variety of input methods.  There are three basic
classes: Lisp implementations, generic platform support, and library
interfaces.

@emph{Lisp implementations} include Quail, which provides table-driven input
methods for almost all the character sets that Mule supports (including
all of the ISO 8859 family, the Indic languages, Thai, and so on), and
SKK, for Japanese.  (SKK also supports an interface to an external
"dictionary server" process.)  Quail supports both typical "dead-key"
methods (eg, in the "latin-1-prefix" method, @kbd{" a} produces ä, LATIN
SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS), and the complex dictionary-based phonetic
methods used for Asian ideographic languages like Chinese.

Lisp implementations can be less powerful (but they are not perceptibly
inefficient), and of course are not portable to non-Emacs applications.
The incompatibility can be very annoying.  On the other hand, they
require no special platform support or external libraries, so if you can
display the characters, Mule can input them for you and you can edit,
anywhere.

@emph{Generic platform support} is currently limited to the X Input
Method (XIM) framework, although support for MSIME (for MS Windows) is
planned, and IIIMF (Sun's Internet-Intranet Input Method Framework)
support is extremely desirable.  XIM is enabled at build time by use of
the @samp{--with-xim} flag to @code{configure}.  For use of XIM, see
your platform documentation.  However, normally the input method you use
is specified via the @samp{LANG} and @samp{XMODIFIERS} environment
variables.

Of course, input skills are portable across most applications.  However,
especially in modern GUI systems the habit of using bucky bits has
fallen into sad disuse, and many XIM systems are poorly configured for
use with Emacs.  For example, the kinput2 input manager (a separate
process providing an interface between Japanese dictionary servers such
as Canna and Wnn, and the application) tends to gobble up keystrokes
generating Meta characters.  This means that to edit while using an XIM
input method, you must toggle the input method off every time you want
to use @kbd{M-f}.  Your mileage may vary.

@emph{Library interfaces} are most common for Japanese, although Wnn
supports Chinese (traditional and simplified) and Korean.  There are
Chinese and Korean input servers available, but we do not know of any
patches for XEmacs to use them directly.  You can use them via
IM-enabled terminals, by manipulating the terminal coding systems.  We
describe only the Japanese-oriented systems here.  The advantage of
these systems is that they are very powerful, and on platforms where
they are available there is typically a wide range of applications that
support them.  Thus your input skills are portable across applications.

Mule provides built-in interfaces to the following input methods: Wnn4,
Wnn6, Canna, and SJ3.  These can be configured at build time.  There are
patches available (no URL, sorry) to support the SKK server, as well.
Wnn and SJ3 use the @code{egg} user interface.  The interface for Canna
is specialized to Canna.

Wnn supports Japanese, Chinese and Korean. It is made by OMRON and Kyôto
University. It is a powerful and complex system.  Wnn4 is free and Wnn6
is not.  Wnn uses grammatical hints and probability of word association,
so in principle Wnn can be cleverer than other methods.

Canna, made by NEC, supports only Japanese.  It is a simple and powerful
system. Canna uses only grammar, but its grammar and dictionary are
quite sophisticated.  So for standard modern Japanese, Canna seems
cleverer than Wnn4. In addition, the UNIX version of Canna is free (now
there is a Microsoft Windows version).

SJ3, by Sony, supports only Japanese.

Egg consists of following parts:

@enumerate
@item
Input character Translation System (ITS) layer.
It translates ASCII inputs to Kana/PinYin/Hangul characters.

@item
Kana/PinYin/Hangul to Kanji transfer layer.
The interface layer to network Kana-Kanji server (Wnn and Sj3).
@end enumerate

These input methods are modal.  They have a raw (alphabet) mode, a
phonetic input mode, and Kana-Kanji transfer mode.  However there are
mode-less input methods for Egg and Canna.  @samp{boiled-egg} is a
mode-less input method running on Egg.  For Canna, @samp{canna.el} has a
tiny boiled-egg-like command, @code{(canna-boil)}, and there are some
boiled-egg-like utilities.

Much of this information was provided by @email{morioka@@jaist.ac.jp,

@node Q1.3.6, Q1.3.7, Q1.3.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.6: How do I portably code for MULE/XEmacs?

MULE has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and the original third
party patch (for GNU Emacs 19), GNU Emacs 20+, and XEmacs 20+ have quite
different implementations.  The APIs also vary although recent versions
of XEmacs have tended to converge to the GNU Emacs standard.

MULE implementations are going to continue to evolve.  Both GNU Emacs
and XEmacs are working hard on Unicode support, which will involve new
APIs and probably variations on old ones.  For XEmacs 22, the old ISO
2022-based system for recognizing encodings will be replaced by a much
more flexible system, which should improve accuracy of automatic coding
detections, but will also involve new APIs.

@quotation
The application implementor must write separate code for these mule
variants.  [Please don't hesitate to report these variants to us; they

MULE and the next version of Emacs are similar but the symbols are very
different---requiring separate code as well.

Namely we must support 3 kinds of mule variants and 4 or 5 or 6 kinds of
emacs variants... (;_;) I'm shocked, so I wrote a wrapper package called
@code{emu} to provide a common interface.  [There is an XEmacs package
of APEL which provides much more comprehensive coverage.  Be careful,
however; APEL has problems of its own. -- Ed.]

I have the following suggestions about dealing with mule variants:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{(featurep 'mule)} @code{t} on all mule variants

@item
@code{(boundp 'MULE)} is @code{t} on only MULE.  Maybe the next version
of Emacs will not have this symbol.

@item
MULE has a variable @code{mule-version}.  Perhaps the next version of
Emacs will have this variable as well.
@end itemize

Following is a sample to distinguish mule variants:

@lisp
(if (featurep 'mule)
    (cond ((boundp 'MULE)
           ;; for original Mule
           )
          ((string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version)
           ;; for XEmacs with Mule
           )
          (t
           ;; for next version of Emacs
           ))
  ;; for old emacs variants
  )

@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.8: Does XEmacs support Unicode?

Partially, as an external encoding for files, processes, and terminals.
It does not yet support Unicode fonts @ref{Q1.3.9, Does XEmacs support
Unicode Fonts?}

To get Unicode support, you need a Mule-enabled XEmacs.  Install
Mule-UCS from packages in the usual way.  Put

@example
(require 'un-define)
(set-coding-priority-list '(utf-8))
(set-coding-category-system 'utf-8 'utf-8)
@end example

in your init file to enable the UTF-8 coding system.  You may wish to
view the documentation of @code{set-coding-priority-list} if you find
that files that are not UTF-8 are being mis-recognized as UTF-8.

Install standard national fonts (not Unicode fonts) for all
character sets you use.  See @ref{Q1.3.9}.

Mule-UCS also supports 16-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-16).  It does not
support 31-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-32 or UCS-4).

@node Q1.3.9, Q1.4.1, Q1.3.8, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.3.9: How does XEmacs display Unicode?

Mule doesn't have a Unicode charset internally, so there's nothing to
bind a Unicode registry to.  It would not be straightforward to create,
either, because Unicode is not ISO 2022-compatible.  You'd have to
translate it to multiple 96x96 pages.

This means that Mule-UCS uses ordinary national fonts for display.  This
is not really a problem, except for those languages that use the Unified
Han characters.  The problem here is that Mule-UCS maps from Unicode
code points to national character sets in a deterministic way.  By
default, this means that Japanese fonts are tried first, then Chinese,
then Korean.  To change the priority ordering, use the command
`un-define-change-charset-order'.

It also means you can't use Unicode fonts directly, at least not without
extreme hackery.  You can run -nw with (set-terminal-coding-system
'utf-8) if you really want a Unicode font for some reason.

Real Unicode support will be introduced in XEmacs 22.0.

@unnumberedsec 1.4: Getting Started, Backing up & Recovery
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.4.1: What is an @file{init.el} or @file{.emacs} and is there a sample one?

The @file{init.el} or @file{.emacs} file is used to customize XEmacs to
your tastes.  Starting in 21.4, the preferred location for the init file
is @file{~/.xemacs/init.el}; in previous versions, it was
@file{~/.emacs}.  21.4 still accepts the old location, but the first
time you run it, it will ask to migrate your file to the new location.
If you answer yes, the file will be moved, and a "compatibility"
@file{.emacs} file will be placed in the old location so that you can
still run older versions of XEmacs, and versions of GNU Emacs, which
expect the old location.  The @file{.emacs} file present is just a stub
that loads the real file in @file{~/.xemacs/init.el}.

No two init files are alike, nor are they expected to be alike, but
that's the point.  The XEmacs distribution contains an excellent starter
example in the @file{etc/} directory called @file{sample.init.el}
(starting in 21.4) or @file{sample.emacs} in older versions.  Copy this
file from there to @file{~/.xemacs/init.el} (starting in 21.4) or
@file{~/.emacs} in older versions, where @samp{~} means your home
directory, of course.  Then edit it to suit.

You may bring the @file{sample.init.el} or @file{sample.emacs} file into
an XEmacs buffer from the menubar. (The menu entry for it is always
under the @samp{Help} menu, but its location under that has changed in
various versions.  Recently, look under the @samp{Samples} submenu.)  To
determine the location of the @file{etc/} directory type the command
@kbd{C-h v data-directory @key{RET}}.

of Emacs.

@node Q1.4.4, Q1.4.5, Q1.4.3, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.4.4: May I see an example of a useful XEmacs Lisp function?

The following function does a little bit of everything useful.  It does
something with the prefix argument, it examines the text around the
cursor, and it's interactive so it may be bound to a key.  It inserts
copies of the current word the cursor is sitting on at the cursor.  If
you give it a prefix argument: @kbd{C-u 3 M-x double-word} then it will
insert 3 copies.

@lisp
(defun double-word (count)
  "Insert a copy of the current word underneath the cursor"
  (interactive "*p")
  (let (here there string)
    (save-excursion
      (forward-word -1)
      (setq here (point))
      (forward-word 1)
      (setq there (point))
      (setq string (buffer-substring here there)))
    (while (>= count 1)
      (insert string)
      (decf count))))
@end lisp

The best way to see what is going on here is to let XEmacs tell you.
Put the code into an XEmacs buffer, and do a @kbd{C-h f} with the cursor
sitting just to the right of the function you want explained.  Eg.  move
the cursor to the SPACE between @code{interactive} and @samp{"*p"} and
hit @kbd{C-h f} to see what the function @code{interactive} does.  Doing
this will tell you that the @code{*} requires a writable buffer, and
@code{p} converts the prefix argument to a number, and
@code{interactive} allows you to execute the command with @kbd{M-x}.

@node Q1.4.5, Q1.4.6, Q1.4.4, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.4.5: And how do I bind it to a key?

To bind to a key do:

@node Q1.4.6, , Q1.4.5, Introduction
@unnumberedsubsec Q1.4.6: What's the difference between a macro and a function?

Quoting from the Lisp Reference (a.k.a @dfn{Lispref}) Manual:

@dfn{Macros} enable you to define new control constructs and other
language features.  A macro is defined much like a function, but instead
of telling how to compute a value, it tells how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  We call this
expression the @dfn{expansion} of the macro.

Macros can do this because they operate on the unevaluated expressions
for the arguments, not on the argument values as functions do.  They can
therefore construct an expansion containing these argument expressions
or parts of them.

Do not confuse the two terms with @dfn{keyboard macros}, which are
another matter, entirely.  A keyboard macro is a key bound to several
other keys.  Refer to manual for details.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.1: Running XEmacs without installing

How can I just try XEmacs without installing it?

XEmacs will run in place without requiring installation and copying of
the Lisp directories, and without having to specify a special build-time
flag.  It's the copying of the Lisp directories that requires so much
space.  XEmacs is largely written in Lisp.

A good method is to make a shell alias for xemacs:

@example
alias xemacs=/i/xemacs-20.2/src/xemacs
@end example

(You will obviously use whatever directory you downloaded the source
tree to instead of @file{/i/xemacs-20.2}).

This will let you run XEmacs without massive copying.

@node Q2.0.2, Q2.0.3, Q2.0.1, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.2: XEmacs is too big

The space required by the installation directories can be
reduced dramatically if desired.  Gzip all the .el files.  Remove all
the packages you'll never want to use.  Remove the TexInfo manuals.
Remove the Info (and use just hardcopy versions of the manual).  Remove
most of the stuff in etc.  Remove or gzip all the source code.  Gzip or
remove the C source code.  Configure it so that copies are not made of
the support lisp.

These are all Emacs Lisp source code and bytecompiled object code.  You
may safely gzip everything named *.el here.  You may remove any package
you don't use.  @emph{Nothing bad will happen if you delete a package
that you do not use}.  You must be sure you do not use it though, so be
conservative at first.

Any package with the possible exceptions of xemacs-base, and EFS are
candidates for removal.  Ask yourself, @emph{Do I ever want to use this
package?}  If the answer is no, then it is a candidate for removal.

First, gzip all the .el files.  Then go about package by package and
start gzipping the .elc files.  Then run XEmacs and do whatever it is
you normally do.  If nothing bad happens, then remove the package.  You
can remove a package via the PUI interface 
(@code{M-x pui-list-packages}, then press @kbd{d} to mark the packages
you wish to delete, and then @kbd{x} to delete them.

Another method is to do @code{M-x package-get-delete-package}.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.3: Compiling XEmacs with Netaudio.

What is the best way to compile XEmacs with the netaudio system, since I
have got the netaudio system compiled but installed at a weird place, I
am not root.  Also in the READMEs it does not say anything about
compiling with the audioserver?

You should only need to add some stuff to the configure command line.
To tell it to compile in netaudio support: @samp{--with-sound=both}, or
@samp{--with-sound=nas} if you don't want native sound support for some
reason.) To tell it where to find the netaudio includes and libraries:

@example
--site-libraries=WHATEVER
--site-includes=WHATEVER
@end example

Then (fingers crossed) it should compile and it will use netaudio if you
have a server running corresponding to the X server. The netaudio server
has to be there when XEmacs starts. If the netaudio server goes away and
another is run, XEmacs should cope (fingers crossed, error handling in
netaudio isn't perfect).

BTW, netaudio has been renamed as it has a name clash with something
else, so if you see references to NAS or Network Audio System, it's the
same thing.  It also might be found at
@uref{ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/}.

That's correct [The SunOS 4.1.3 precompiled binaries don't do name
lookup].  Since Sun figured that everyone used NIS to do name lookups
(that DNS thing was apparently only a passing fad, right?), the stock
SunOS 4.x systems don't have DNS-based name lookups in libc.

This is also why Netscape ships two binaries for SunOS 4.1.x.

The best solution is to compile it yourself; the configure script will
check to see if you've put DNS in the shared libc and will then proceed
to link against the DNS resolver library code.

@email{cognot@@fronsac.ensg.u-nancy.fr, Richard Cognot} writes:

@quotation
Because of the way XEmacs (and every other Emacsen, AFAIK) is built. The
link gives you a bare-boned emacs (called temacs). temacs is then run,
preloading some of the lisp files. The result is then dumped into a new
executable, named xemacs, which will contain all of the preloaded lisp
functions and data.

Now, during the dump itself, the executable (code+data+symbols) is
written on disk using a special unexec() function. This function is
obviously heavily system dependent. And on some systems, it leads to an
executable which, although valid, cannot be stripped without damage. If
memory serves, this is especially the case for AIX binaries. On other
architectures it might work OK.

The Right Way to strip the emacs binary is to strip temacs prior to
dumping xemacs. This will always work, although you can do that only if
you install from sources (as temacs is @file{not} part of the binary

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.13: I don't need no steenkin' packages.  Do I?

Strictly speaking, no.  XEmacs will build and install just fine without
any packages installed.  However, only the most basic editing functions
will be available with no packages installed, so installing packages is
an essential part of making your installed XEmacs _useful_.

@node Q2.0.14, Q2.0.15, Q2.0.13, Installation
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.0.14: How do I figure out which packages to install?

Many people really liked the old way that packages were bundled and do
not want to mess with packages at all.  You can grab all the packages at
once like you used to with old XEmacs versions.  Download the file

@file{xemacs-sumo.tar.gz}

For an XEmacs compiled with Mule you also need

@file{xemacs-mule-sumo.tar.gz}

from the @file{packages} directory on your XEmacs mirror archive.
N.B. They are called 'Sumo Tarballs' for good reason. They are
currently about 15MB and 2.3MB (gzipped) respectively.

Install them by

@code{cd $prefix/lib/xemacs ; gunzip -c <tarballname> | tar xf -}

See README.packages for more detailed installation instructions.

As the Sumo tarballs are not regenerated as often as the individual
packages, it is recommended that you use the automatic package tools
afterwards to pick up any recent updates.

@unnumberedsec 2.1: Trouble Shooting
@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.1: Help!  XEmacs just crashed on me!

First of all, don't panic.  Whenever XEmacs crashes, it tries extremely
hard to auto-save all of your files before dying.  (The main time that
this will not happen is if the machine physically lost power or if you
killed the XEmacs process using @code{kill -9}).  The next time you try
to edit those files, you will be informed that a more recent auto-save
file exists.  You can use @kbd{M-x recover-file} to retrieve the
auto-saved version of the file.

You can use the command @kbd{M-x recover-session} after a crash to pick
up where you left off.

Now, XEmacs is not perfect, and there may occasionally be times, or
particular sequences of actions, that cause it to crash.  If you can
come up with a reproducible way of doing this (or even if you have a
pretty good memory of exactly what you were doing at the time), the
maintainers would be very interested in knowing about it.  The best way
to report a bug is using @kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug} (or by selecting
@samp{Send Bug Report...} from the Help menu).  If that won't work
(e.g. you can't get XEmacs working at all), send ordinary mail to
@email{crashes@@xemacs.org}. @emph{MAKE SURE} to include the output from
the crash, especially including the Lisp backtrace, as well as the
XEmacs configuration from @kbd{M-x describe-installation} (or
equivalently, the file @file{Installation} in the top of the build
tree).  Please note that the @samp{crashes} address is exclusively for
crash reports.  The best way to report bugs in general is through the
@kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug} interface just mentioned, or if necessary by
emailing @email{xemacs-beta@@xemacs.org}.  Note that the developers do
@emph{not} usually follow @samp{comp.emacs.xemacs} on a regular basis;
thus, this is better for general questions about XEmacs than bug
reports.

If at all possible, include a C stack backtrace of the core dump that
was produced.  This shows where exactly things went wrong, and makes it
much easier to diagnose problems.  To do this under Unix, you need to
locate the core file (it's called @file{core}, and is usually sitting in
the directory that you started XEmacs from, or your home directory if
that other directory was not writable).  Then, go to that directory and
execute a command like:

@example
gdb `which xemacs` core
@end example

and then issue the command @samp{where} to get the stack backtrace.  You
might have to use @code{dbx} or some similar debugger in place of
@code{gdb}.  If you don't have any such debugger available, complain to
your system administrator.

It's possible that a core file didn't get produced, in which case you're
out of luck.  Go complain to your system administrator and tell him not
to disable core files by default.  Also see @ref{Q2.1.15}, for tips and
techniques for dealing with a debugger.

If you're under Microsoft Windows, you're out of luck unless you happen
to have a debugging aid installed on your system, for example Visual
C++.  In this case, the crash will result in a message giving you the
option to enter a debugger (for example, by pressing @samp{Cancel}).  Do
this and locate the stack-trace window. (If your XEmacs was built
without debugging information, the stack trace may not be very useful.)

When making a problem report make sure that:

@enumerate
@item
Report @strong{all} of the information output by XEmacs during the
crash.

@item
You mention what O/S & Hardware you are running XEmacs on.

@item
What version of XEmacs you are running.

@item
What build options you are using.

@item
If the problem is related to graphics and you are running Unix, we will
also need to know what version of the X Window System you are running,
and what window manager you are using.

@item
If the problem happened on a TTY, please include the terminal type.
@end enumerate

Much of the information above is automatically generated by @kbd{M-x
report-emacs-bug}.  Even more, and often useful, information can be
generated by redirecting the output of @code{make} and @code{make check}
to a file (@file{beta.err} is the default used by @code{build-report}),
and executing @kbd{M-x build-report}.

I get tons of translation table syntax error messages during startup.
How do I get rid of them?

There are two causes of this problem.  The first usually only strikes
people using the prebuilt binaries.  The culprit in both cases is the
file @file{XKeysymDB}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The binary cannot find the @file{XKeysymDB} file.  The location is
hardcoded at compile time so if the system the binary was built on puts
it a different place than your system does, you have problems.  To fix,
set the environment variable @code{XKEYSYMDB} to the location of the
@file{XKeysymDB} file on your system or to the location of the one
included with XEmacs which should be at
@iftex

@end iftex
@file{<xemacs_root_directory>/lib/xemacs-19.16/etc/XKeysymDB}.

@item
The binary is finding the XKeysymDB but it is out-of-date on your system
and does not contain the necessary lines.  Either ask your system
administrator to replace it with the one which comes with XEmacs (which
is the stock R6 version and is backwards compatible) or set your
@code{XKEYSYMDB} variable to the location of XEmacs's described above.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.15: How to debug an XEmacs problem with a debugger

If XEmacs does crash on you, one of the most productive things you can
do to help get the bug fixed is to poke around a bit with the debugger.
Here are some hints:

@itemize @bullet
@item
First of all, if the crash is at all reproducible, consider very
strongly recompiling your XEmacs with debugging symbols and with no
optimization (e.g. with GCC use the compiler flags @samp{-g -O0} --
that's an "oh" followed by a zero), and with the configure options
@samp{--debug=yes} and @samp{--error-checking=all}.  This will make your
XEmacs run somewhat slower, but you are a lot more likely to catch the
problem earlier (closer to its source).  It makes it a lot easier to
determine what's going on with a debugger.

@item
If it's not a true crash (@emph{i.e.}, XEmacs is hung, or a zombie
process), or it's inconvenient to run XEmacs again because XEmacs is
already running or is running in batch mode as part of a bunch of
scripts, you may be able to attach to the existing process with your
debugger.  Most debuggers let you do this by substituting the process ID
for the core file when you invoke the debugger from the command line, or
by using the @code{attach} command or something similar.

@item
If you're able to run XEmacs under a debugger and reproduce the crash,
here are some things you can do:

@item
If XEmacs is hitting an assertion failure, put a breakpoint on
@code{assert_failed()}.

@item
If XEmacs is hitting some weird Lisp error that's causing it to crash
(e.g. during startup), put a breakpoint on @code{signal_1()}---this is
declared static in eval.c.

@item
If XEmacs is outputting lots of X errors, put a breakpoint on
@code{x_error_handler()}; that will tell you which call is causing them.

@item
Internally, you will probably see lots of variables that hold objects of
type @code{Lisp_Object}.  These are references to Lisp objects.
Printing them out with the debugger probably won't be too
useful---you'll likely just see a number.  To decode them, do this:

@example
call dp (OBJECT)
@end example

where @var{OBJECT} is whatever you want to decode (it can be a variable,
a function call, etc.).  This uses the Lisp printing routines to out a
readable representation on the TTY from which the xemacs process was
invoked.

@item
If you want to get a Lisp backtrace showing the Lisp call
stack, do this:

@example
call db ()
@end example

@item
Using @code{dp} and @code{db} has two disadvantages - they can only be
used with a running (including hung or zombie) xemacs process, and they
do not display the internal C structure of a Lisp Object.  Even if all
you've got is a core dump, all is not lost.

If you're using GDB, there are some macros in the file
@file{src/.gdbinit} in the XEmacs source distribution that should make
it easier for you to decode Lisp objects.  This file is automatically
read by gdb if gdb is run in the directory where xemacs was built, and
contains these useful macros to inspect the state of xemacs:

@table @code
@item pobj
Usage: pobj lisp_object @*
Print the internal C representation of a lisp object.

@item xtype
Usage: xtype lisp_object @*
Print the Lisp type of a lisp object.

@item lbt
Usage: lbt @*
Print the current Lisp stack trace.
Requires a running xemacs process.  (It works by calling the db
routine described above.)

@item ldp
Usage: ldp lisp_object @*
Print a Lisp Object value using the Lisp printer.
Requires a running xemacs process.  (It works by calling the dp
routine described above.)

@item run-temacs
Usage: run-temacs @*
Run temacs interactively, like xemacs.
Use this with debugging tools (like purify) that cannot deal with dumping,
or when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.

@item dump-temacs
Usage: dump-temacs @*
Run the dumping part of the build procedure.
Use when debugging temacs, not xemacs!
Use this when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.

@item check-xemacs
Usage: check-xemacs @*
Run the test suite.  Equivalent to 'make check'.

@item check-temacs
Usage: check-temacs @*
Run the test suite on temacs.  Equivalent to 'make check-temacs'.
Use this with debugging tools (like purify) that cannot deal with dumping,
or when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.
@end table

If you are using Sun's @file{dbx} debugger, there is an equivalent file
@file{src/.dbxrc}, which defines the same commands for dbx.

@item
If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're seeing
stack traces with some of the innermost frames mangled, it may be due to
dynamic linking. (This happens especially under Linux.) Consider
reconfiguring with @samp{--dynamic=no}.  Also, sometimes (again under
Linux), stack backtraces of core dumps will have the frame where the
fatal signal occurred mangled; if you can obtain a stack trace while
running the XEmacs process under a debugger, the stack trace should be
clean.

@email{1CMC3466@@ibm.mtsac.edu, Curtiss} suggests upgrading to ld.so
version 1.8 if dynamic linking and debugging is a problem on Linux.

@item
If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're
getting a completely mangled and bogus stack trace, it's probably due to
one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Your executable has been stripped.  Bad news.  Tell your sysadmin not to
do this---it doesn't accomplish anything except to save a bit of disk
space, and makes debugging much much harder.

@item
Your stack is getting trashed.  Debugging this is hard; you have to do a
binary-search type of narrowing down where the crash occurs, until you
figure out exactly which line is causing the problem.  Of course, this
only works if the bug is highly reproducible.  Also, in many cases if
you run XEmacs from the debugger, the debugger can protect the stack
somewhat.  However, if the stack is being smashed, it is typically the
case that there is a wild pointer somewhere in the program, often quite
far from where the crash occurs.

@item
If your stack trace has exactly one frame in it, with address 0x0, this
could simply mean that XEmacs attempted to execute code at that address,
e.g. through jumping to a null function pointer.  Unfortunately, under
those circumstances, GDB under Linux doesn't know how to get a stack
trace. (Yes, this is the fourth Linux-related problem I've mentioned.  I
have no idea why GDB under Linux is so bogus.  Complain to the GDB
authors, or to comp.os.linux.development.system.) Again, you'll have to
use the narrowing-down process described above.

@item
You will get a Lisp backtrace output when XEmacs crashes, so you'll have
something useful.

@end enumerate

@item
If you compile with the newer gcc variants gcc-2.8 or egcs, you will
also need gdb 4.17 or above.  Earlier releases of gdb can't handle the
debug information generated by the newer compilers.

@item
In versions of XEmacs before 21.2.27, @file{src/.gdbinit} was named
@file{src/gdbinit}.  This had the disadvantage of not being sourced
automatically by gdb, so you had to set that up yourself.

@item
If you are running Microsoft Windows, the the file @file{nt/README} for
further information about debugging XEmacs.

When using one of the prebuilt binaries many users have observed that
XEmacs uses the timezone under which it was built, but not the timezone
under which it is running.  The solution is to add:

@lisp
(set-time-zone-rule "MET")
@end lisp

to your @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs} or the @file{site-start.el} file if
you can.  Replace @code{MET} with your local timezone.

@unnumberedsubsec Q2.1.22: XEmacs seems to take a really long time to do some things

@email{dmoore@@ucsd.edu, David Moore} writes:

@quotation
Two things you can do:

1) C level:

When you see it going mad like this, you might want to use gdb from an
'xterm' to attach to the running process and get a stack trace.  To do
this just run:

@example
gdb /path/to/xemacs/xemacs ####
@end example

Where @code{####} is the process id of your xemacs, instead of
specifying the core.  When gdb attaches, the xemacs will stop [1] and
you can type `where' in gdb to get a stack trace as usual.  To get
things moving again, you can just type `quit' in gdb.  It'll tell you
the program is running and ask if you want to quit anyways.  Say 'y' and
it'll quit and have your emacs continue from where it was at.

2) Lisp level:

Turn on debug-on-quit early on.  When you think things are going slow
hit C-g and it may pop you in the debugger so you can see what routine
is running.  Press `c' to get going again.

debug-on-quit doesn't work if something's turned on inhibit-quit or in
some other strange cases.

You have been used to doing `foo', but now when you invoke it (or click

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.1: What version of Emacs am I running?

How can @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs} determine which of the family of
Emacsen I am using?

To determine if you are currently running GNU Emacs 18, GNU Emacs 19,
XEmacs 19, XEmacs 20, or Epoch, and use appropriate code, check out the
example given in @file{etc/sample.init.el} (@file{etc/sample.emacs} in
XEmacs versions prior to 21.4).  There are other nifty things in there
as well!

For all new code, all you really need to do is:

@lisp
(defvar running-xemacs (string-match "XEmacs\\|Lucid" emacs-version))
@end lisp

@node Q3.0.2, Q3.0.3, Q3.0.1, Customization
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.2: How can I evaluate Emacs-Lisp expressions?

I know I can evaluate Elisp expressions from @code{*scratch*} buffer
with @kbd{C-j} after the expression.  How do I do it from another
buffer?

Press @kbd{M-:} (the default binding of @code{eval-expression}), and
enter the expression to the minibuffer.

@node Q3.0.3, Q3.0.4, Q3.0.2, Customization
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.3: @code{(setq tab-width 6)} behaves oddly.

If you put @code{(setq tab-width 6)} in your
@file{init.el}/@file{.emacs} file it does not work!  Is there a reason
for this?  If you do it at the EVAL prompt it works fine!! How strange.

Use @code{setq-default} instead, since @code{tab-width} is
all-buffer-local.

@node Q3.0.4, Q3.0.5, Q3.0.3, Customization
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.4: How can I add directories to the @code{load-path}?

Here are two ways to do that, one that puts your directories at the
front of the load-path, the other at the end:

@lisp
;;; Add things at the beginning of the load-path, do not add
;;; duplicate directories:
(pushnew "bar" load-path :test 'equal)

(pushnew "foo" load-path :test 'equal)

;;; Add things at the end, unconditionally
(setq load-path (nconc load-path '("foo" "bar")))

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.5: How to check if a lisp function is defined?

Use the following elisp:

@end lisp

It's almost always a mistake to test @code{emacs-version} or any similar
variables.

Instead, use feature-tests, such as @code{featurep}, @code{boundp},
@code{fboundp}, or even simple behavioral tests, eg.:

@lisp
(defvar foo-old-losing-code-p
  (condition-case nil (progn (losing-code t) nil)
    (wrong-number-of-arguments t)))
@end lisp

There is an incredible amount of broken code out there which could work
much better more often in more places if it did the above instead of
trying to divine its environment from the value of one variable.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.0.6: Can I force the output of @code{(face-list)} to a buffer?

It would be good having it in a buffer, as the output of
@code{(face-list)} is too wide to fit to a minibuffer.

Evaluate the expression in the @samp{*scratch*} buffer with point after
the rightmost paren and typing @kbd{C-j}.

If the minibuffer smallness is the only problem you encounter, you can
simply press @kbd{C-h l} to get the former minibuffer contents in a
buffer.

In addition, an @file{app-defaults} file @file{etc/Emacs.ad} is
supplied, listing the defaults.  The file @file{etc/sample.Xresources}
gives a different set of defaults that you might consider for
installation in your @file{~/.Xresources} file.  It is nearly the same
as @file{etc/Emacs.ad}, but a few entries are altered.  Be careful about

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.1.7: @samp{xemacs -name junk} doesn't work?

When I run @samp{xterm -name junk}, I get an xterm whose class name
according to xprop, is @samp{junk}.  This is the way it's supposed to
work, I think.  When I run @samp{xemacs -name junk} the class name is
not set to @samp{junk}.  It's still @samp{emacs}.  What does
@samp{xemacs -name} really do?  The reason I ask is that my window
manager (fvwm) will make a window sticky and I use XEmacs to read my
mail.  I want that XEmacs window to be sticky, without having to use the
window manager's function to set the window sticky.  What gives?

@samp{xemacs -name} sets the application name for the program (that is,
the thing which normally comes from @samp{argv[0]}).  Using @samp{-name}
is the same as making a copy of the executable with that new name.  The
@code{WM_CLASS} property on each frame is set to the frame-name, and the
application-class.  So, if you did @samp{xemacs -name FOO} and then
created a frame named @var{BAR}, you'd get an X window with WM_CLASS =
@code{( "BAR", "Emacs")}.  However, the resource hierarchy for this
widget would be:

@example
Name:    FOO   .shell             .container   .BAR
Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame
@end example

instead of the default

@example
Name:    xemacs.shell             .container   .emacs
Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame
@end example


It is arguable that the first element of WM_CLASS should be set to the
application-name instead of the frame-name, but I think that's less
flexible, since it does not give you the ability to have multiple frames
with different WM_CLASS properties.  Another possibility would be for
the default frame name to come from the application name instead of
simply being @samp{emacs}.  However, at this point, making that change
would be troublesome: it would mean that many users would have to make
yet another change to their resource files (since the default frame name
would suddenly change from @samp{emacs} to @samp{xemacs}, or whatever
the executable happened to be named), so we'd rather avoid it.

To make a frame with a particular name use:

@lisp
(make-frame '((name . "the-name")))

Note that you should use @samp{Emacs.} and not @samp{Emacs*} when
setting face values.

In @file{.Xresources}:

@example
Emacs.default.attributeFont:  -*-*-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-m-*-*-*
Emacs*menubar*font:           fixed
Emacs.modeline.attributeFont: fixed
@end example

This is confusing because @samp{default} and @samp{modeline} are face
names, and can be found listed with all faces in the current mode by
using @kbd{M-x set-face-font (enter) ?}.  They use the face-specific
resource @samp{attributeFont}.

On the other hand, @samp{menubar} is a normal X thing that uses the
resource @samp{font}.  With Motif it @emph{may be} necessary to use
@samp{fontList} @emph{instead of} @samp{font}.  In @emph{non-Motif}
configurations with Mule it @emph{is} necessary to use @samp{fontSet}
instead of @samp{font}.  (Sorry, there just is no simple recipe here.)

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.2.4: How can I limit color map usage?

I'm using Netscape (or another color grabber like XEmacs);
is there any way to limit the number of available colors in the color map?

Answer: No, but you can start Netscape before XEmacs, and it will use
the closest available color if the colormap is full.  You can also limit
the number of colors Netscape uses, using the flags -mono, -ncols <#> or
-install (for mono, limiting to <#> colors, or for using a private color
map).

If you have the money, another solution would be to use a truecolor or
direct color video.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.2.7: How do I display non-ASCII characters?
@c New

If you're using a Mule-enabled XEmacs, then display is automatic.  If
you're not seeing the characters you expect, either (1) you don't have
appropriate fonts available or (2) XEmacs did not correctly detect the
coding system (@pxref{Recognize Coding, , , xemacs}).  In case (1),
install fonts as is customary for your platform.  In case (2), you
need to tell XEmacs explicitly what coding systems you're using.
@ref{Specify Coding, , , xemacs}.

If your XEmacs is not Mule-enabled, and for some reason getting a
Mule-enabled XEmacs seems like the wrong thing to do, all is not lost.
You can arrange it by brute force.  In @file{event-Xt.c} (suppress the
urge to look in this file---play Doom instead, because you'll survive

Then, when editing a Lisp file (i.e. when in Lisp mode), the modeline
colors change from the default set in your @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs}.
The change will only be made in the buffer you just entered (which
contains the Lisp file you are editing) and will not affect the modeline
colors anywhere else.

Notes:

@itemize @bullet

@item The hook is the mode name plus @code{-hook}.  eg. c-mode-hook,

lisp-interaction-mode-hook (the @samp{*scratch*} buffer),
text-mode-hook, etc.

Be sure to use @code{add-hook}, not @code{(setq c-mode-hook xxxx)},
otherwise you will erase anything that anybody has already put on the
hook.

You can also do @code{(set-face-font 'modeline @var{font})},
eg. @code{(set-face-font 'modeline "*bold-r-normal*140-100-100*"

@unnumberedsec 3.5: The Keyboard
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.5.1: How can I bind complex functions (or macros) to keys?

As an example, say you want the @kbd{paste} key on a Sun keyboard to
insert the current Primary X selection at point. You can accomplish this
with:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [f18] 'x-insert-selection)
@end lisp

However, this only works if there is a current X selection (the
selection will be highlighted).  The functionality I like is for the
@kbd{paste} key to insert the current X selection if there is one,
otherwise insert the contents of the clipboard.  To do this you need to
pass arguments to @code{x-insert-selection}.  This is done by wrapping
the call in a 'lambda form:

@lisp
(global-set-key [f18]
  (lambda () (interactive) (x-insert-selection t nil)))
@end lisp

This binds the f18 key to a @dfn{generic} functional object.  The
interactive spec is required because only interactive functions can be
bound to keys.

For the FAQ example you could use:

@lisp
(global-set-key [(control ?.)]
  (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up 1)))
(global-set-key [(control ?;)]
  (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up -1)))

This is fine if you only need a few functions within the lambda body.

@c chr ;)
@example
        xmodmap -e 'keycode 0xff20 = Multi_key'

You will need to pick an appropriate keycode. Use xev to find out the
keycodes for each key.

[NB: On a `Windows' keyboard, recent versions of XFree86 automatically
define the right `Windows' key as Multi_key'.]

Once you have Multi_key defined, you can use e.g.
@example

        Multi e "       => ë
        Multi c ,       => ç

Also, recent versions of XFree86 define various AltGr-<key>
combinations as dead keys, i.e.
@example
        AltGr [         => dead_diaeresis
        AltGr ]         => dead_tilde

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.7.8: Why does @kbd{M-w} take so long?

It actually doesn't.  It leaves the region visible for a second so that
you can see what area is being yanked.  If you start working, though, it
will immediately complete its operation.  In other words, it will only
delay for a second if you let it.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.8.4: Resources like @code{Emacs*menubar*font} are not working?

I am trying to use a resource like @code{Emacs*menubar*font} to set the
font of the menubar but it's not working.

In Motif, the use of @samp{font} resources is obsoleted in order to
support internationalization.  If you are using the real Motif menubar,
this resource is not recognized at all; you have to say:

@example
Emacs*menubar*fontList: FONT
@end example

If you are using the Lucid menubar, for backward compatibility with
existing user configurations, the @samp{font} resource is recognized.
Since this is not supported by Motif itself, the code is a kludge and
the @samp{font} resource will be recognized only if the @samp{fontList}
resource resource is unset.  This means that the resource

@example
*fontList: FONT
@end example

will override

@example
Emacs*menubar*font: FONT
@end example

even though the latter is more specific.

In non-Motif configurations using @samp{--with-mule} and
@samp{--with-xfs} it @emph{is} necessary to use the @code{fontSet}
resource @emph{instead of} the @code{font} resource.  The backward
compatibility kludge was never implemented for non-Motif builds.
Example:

@example
*fontSet: FONT
@end example

@end example

Or select from the @code{Options} menu @code{Frame Appearance->Scrollbars}.
Remember to save options.

To turn the scrollbar off on a per-frame basis, use the following
function:

@lisp
(set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (selected-frame))
@end lisp

You can actually turn the scrollbars on at any level you want by
substituting for (selected-frame) in the above command.  For example, to
turn the scrollbars off only in a single buffer:

@lisp
(set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (current-buffer))
@end lisp
@c
@c In XEmacs versions prior to 19.14, you had to use the hairier construct:

When I move the scrollbar in an XEmacs window, it moves the point as

feature?  Can I disable it?

The current behavior is a feature, not a bug.  Point remains at the same
buffer position as long as that position does not scroll off the screen.
In that event, point will end up in either the upper-left or lower-left
hand corner.

This cannot be changed.

Do @code{(setq truncate-lines t)} in the mode-hooks for any modes
in which you want lines truncated.

More precisely: If @code{truncate-lines} is nil, horizontal scrollbars
will never appear.  Otherwise, they will appear only if the value of
@code{scrollbar-height} for that buffer/window/etc. is non-zero.  If you
do

@lisp

@end lisp

then horizontal scrollbars will not appear in truncated buffers unless
the package specifically asked for them.

@unnumberedsec 3.10: Text Selections
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.10.1: How can I turn off or change highlighted selections?

The @code{zmacs} mode allows for what some might call gratuitous
highlighting for selected regions (either by setting mark or by using
the mouse).  This is the default behavior.  To turn off, add the
following line to your @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(setq zmacs-regions nil)
@end lisp

Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize. Select
from the @code{Options} menu @code{Advanced (Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Basics->Zmacs
Regions} or type @kbd{M-x customize @key{RET} editing-basics @key{RET}}.

To change the face for selection, look at @code{Options->Customize} on
the menubar.

@node Q3.10.2, Q3.10.3, Q3.10.1, Customization
@unnumberedsubsec Q3.10.2: How do I get that typing on an active region removes it?

I want to change things so that if I select some text and start typing,
the typed text replaces the selected text, similar to Motif.

You want to use something called @dfn{pending delete}.  Pending delete
is what happens when you select a region (with the mouse or keyboard)
and you press a key to replace the selected region by the key you typed.
Usually backspace kills the selected region.

To get this behavior, ensure that you have the @file{pc} package
installed, and add the following lines to your
@file{init.el}/@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(cond
 ((fboundp 'turn-on-pending-delete)
  (turn-on-pending-delete))
 ((fboundp 'pending-delete-on)
  (pending-delete-on t)))
@end lisp

Note that this will work with both Backspace and Delete.  This code is a
tad more complicated than it has to be for XEmacs in order to make it
more portable.

Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize. Type
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} isearch-highlight @key{RET}}.

Note also that isearch-highlight affects query-replace and ispell.

@unnumberedsubsec Q3.10.6: Why is killing so slow?

This actually is an X Windows question, although you'll notice it with
keyboard operations as well as while using the GUI.  Basically, there
are four ways to communicate interprogram via the X server:

@table @strong
@item Primary selection
a transient selection that gets replaced every time a new selection is made

@item Secondary selection
for "exchanging" with the primary selection

@item Cut buffers
a clipboard internal to the X server (deprecated)

@item Clipboard selection
a selection with a notification protocol that allows a separate app to
manage the clipboard
@end table

The cut buffers are deprecated because managing them is even more
inefficient than the clipboard notification protocol.  The primary
selection works fine for many users and applications, but is not very
robust under intensive or sophisticated use.

In Motif and MS Windows, a clipboard has become the primary means for
managing cut and paste.  These means that "modern" applications tend to
be oriented toward a true clipboard, rather than the primary selection.
(On Windows, there is nothing equivalent to the primary selection.)
It's not that XEmacs doesn't support the simple primary selection
method, it's that more and more other applications don't.

So the slowdown occurs because XEmacs now engages in the clipboard
notification protocol on @emph{every} kill.  This is especially slow on
Motif.

With most people running most clients and server on the same host, and
many of the rest working over very fast communication, you may expect
that the situation is not going to improve.

There are a number of workarounds.  The most effective is to use a
special command to do selection ownership only when you intend to paste
to another application.  Useful commands are @code{kill-primary-selection}
and @code{copy-primary-selection}.  These work only on text selected
with the mouse (probably; experiment), and are bound by default to the
@kbd{Cut} and @kbd{Copy}, respectively, buttons on the toolbar.
@code{copy-primary-selection} is also bound to @kbd{C-Insert}.  You can
yank the clipboard contents with @code{yank-primary-selection}, bound to
the @kbd{Paste} toolbar button and @kbd{Sh-Insert}.

If you are communicating by cut and paste with applications that use the
primary selection, then you can customize
@code{interprogram-cut-function} to @code{nil}, restoring the XEmacs
version 20 behavior.  How can you tell if a program will support this?
Motifly-correct programs require the clipboard; you lose.  For others,
only by trying it.  You also need to customize the complementary
@code{interprogram-paste-function} to @code{nil}.  (Otherwise
XEmacs-to-XEmacs pastes will not work correctly.)

You may get some relief on Motif by setting
@code{x-selection-strict-motif-ownership} to nil, but this means you will
only intermittently be able to paste XEmacs kills to Motif applications.

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.0.9: rmail or VM gets an error incorporating new mail.

Quoting the XEmacs PROBLEMS file:

@quotation
rmail and VM get new mail from @file{/usr/spool/mail/$USER} using a
program called @code{movemail}.  This program interlocks with
@code{/bin/mail} using the protocol defined by @code{/bin/mail}.

There are two different protocols in general use.  One of them uses the
@code{flock} system call.  The other involves creating a lock file;
@code{movemail} must be able to write in @file{/usr/spool/mail} in order
to do this.  You control which one is used by defining, or not defining,
the macro @code{MAIL_USE_FLOCK} in @file{config.h} or the m- or s- file
it includes.

@strong{IF YOU DON'T USE THE FORM OF INTERLOCKING THAT IS NORMAL ON YOUR
SYSTEM, YOU CAN LOSE MAIL!}

If your system uses the lock file protocol, and fascist restrictions
prevent ordinary users from writing the lock files in
@file{/usr/spool/mail}, you may need to make @code{movemail} setgid to a
suitable group such as @samp{mail}.  You can use these commands (as
root):

@example
chgrp mail movemail
chmod 2755 movemail
@end example

If your system uses the lock file protocol, and fascist restrictions
prevent ordinary users from writing the lock files in
@file{/usr/spool/mail}, you may need to make @code{movemail} setgid to a
suitable group such as @code{mail}.  To do this, use the following
commands (as root) after doing the make install.

@example
chgrp mail movemail
chmod 2755 movemail
@end example

Installation normally copies movemail from the build directory to an
installation directory which is usually under @file{/usr/local/lib}.
The installed copy of @code{movemail} is usually in the directory
@file{/usr/local/lib/emacs/VERSION/TARGET}.  You must change the group
and mode of the installed copy; changing the group and mode of the build
directory copy is ineffective.

The toolbar code to start Gnus opens the new frame---and it's a feature
rather than a bug.  If you don't like it, but would still like to click
on the seemly icon, use the following code:

@lisp
(defun toolbar-news ()
  (gnus))
@end lisp

It will redefine the callback function of the icon to just call
@code{gnus}, without all the fancy frame stuff.

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.3.2: What is TM and where do I get it?

TM stands for @dfn{Tools for MIME} and not Tiny MIME.  TM integrates
with all major XEmacs packages like Gnus (all flavors), VM, MH-E, and
mailcrypt.  It provides totally transparent and trouble-free MIME
support.  When appropriate a message will be decoded in place in an
XEmacs buffer.

TM now comes as a package with XEmacs 19.16 and XEmacs 20.2.

TM was written by @email{morioka@@jaist.ac.jp, MORIOKA Tomohiko} and
@email{shuhei-k@@jaist.ac.jp, KOBAYASHI
Shuhei}.

It is based on the work of @email{umerin@@mse.kyutech.ac.jp, UMEDA
Masanobu}, the original writer of GNUS.

The following information is from the @file{README}:

@dfn{tm} is a MIME package for GNU Emacs.
tm has following functions:

@itemize @bullet
@item MIME style multilingual header.
@item MIME message viewer (mime/viewer-mode).
@item MIME message composer (mime/editor-mode).

EOS is the integration of XEmacs with the SPARCworks debugger.  It

@unnumberedsec 4.6: Infodock
@unnumberedsubsec Q4.6.1: What is Infodock?

@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/infodock/, InfoDock} is an
integrated productivity toolset, mainly aimed at technical people,
hosted at SourceForge.

InfoDock is built atop the XEmacs variant of GNU Emacs and so has all of
the power of Emacs, but with an easier to use and more comprehensive
menu-based user interface.  The bottom portion of this text describes
how it differs from XEmacs and GNU Emacs from the Free Software
Foundation.

InfoDock is aimed at people who want a free, turn-key productivity
environment.  Although InfoDock is customizable, it is not intended for
people who like basic versions of Emacs which need to be customized
extensively for local use; standard Emacs distributions are better for
such uses.  InfoDock is for those people who want a complete,
pre-customized environment in one package, which they need not touch
more than once or twice a year to update to new revisions.

InfoDock is pre-built for SPARC SunOS/Solaris systems, PA-RISC HP-UX,
and Intel Linux systems.  It is intended for use on a color display,
although most features will work on monochrome monitors.  Simply unpack
InfoDock according to the instructions in the ID-INSTALL file and you
are ready to run.

The InfoDock Manual is concise, yet sufficient as a user guide for users
who have never used an Emacs-type editor before.  For users who are
already familiar with Emacs, it supplements the information in the GNU
Emacs Manual.

InfoDock menus are much more extensive and more mature than standard
Emacs menus.  Each menu offers a @samp{Manual} item which displays
documentation associated with the menu's functions.

@noindent
Four types of menubars are provided:
@enumerate
@item
An extensive menubar providing access to global InfoDock commands.
@item
Mode-specific menubars tailored to the current major mode.
@item
A simple menubar for basic editing to help novices get started with InfoDock.
@item
The standard XEmacs menubar.
@end enumerate

Most modes also include mode-specific popup menus.  Additionally, region and
rectangle popup menus are included.

@samp{Hyperbole}, the everyday information manager, is a core part of
InfoDock.  This provides context-sensitive mouse keys, a rolodex-type
contact manager, programmable hypertext buttons, and an autonumbered
outliner with embedded hyperlink anchors.

The @samp{OO-Browser}, a multi-language object-oriented code browser, is a
standard part of InfoDock.

InfoDock saves a more extensive set of user options than other Emacs
versions.

InfoDock inserts a useful file header in many file types, showing the
author, summary, and last modification time of each file.  A summary
program can then be used to summarize all of the files in a directory,
for easy MANIFEST file creation.

Your working set of buffers is automatically saved and restored (if you
answer yes to a prompt) between InfoDock sessions.

Refined color choices for code highlighting are provided for both dark and
light background display frames.

The @kbd{C-z} key prefix performs frame-based commands which parallel the
@kbd{C-x} key prefix for window-based commands.

The Smart Menu system is included for producing command menus on dumb
terminals.

Lisp libraries are better categorized according to function.

Extensions and improvements to many areas of Emacs are included, such as:
paragraph filling, mail reading with Rmail, shell handling, outlining, code
highlighting and browsing, and man page browsing.

InfoDock questions, answers and discussion should go to the mail list

@email{infodock@@infodock.com}.  Use
@email{infodock-request@@infodock.com} to be added or removed from the
list.  Always include your InfoDock version number when sending help
requests.

InfoDock is available across the Internet via anonymous FTP.  To get
it, first move to a directory into which you want the InfoDock archive
files placed.  We will call this <DIST-DIR>.

@example
   cd <DIST-DIR>
@end example

Ftp to ftp.xemacs.org  (Internet Host ID = 128.174.252.16):

@example
   prompt> ftp ftp.xemacs.org
@end example

Login as @samp{anonymous} with your own <user-id>@@<site-name> as a password.

@example
   Name (ftp.xemacs.org): anonymous
   331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
   Password: -<your-user-id>@@<your-domain>
   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
@end example

Move to the location of the InfoDock archives:

@example
   ftp> cd pub/infodock
@end example

Set your transfer mode to binary:

@example
   ftp> bin
   200 Type set to I.
@end example

Turn off prompting:

@example
   ftp> prompt
   Interactive mode off.
@end example

Retrieve the InfoDock archives that you want, either by using a
@samp{get <file>} for each file you want or by using the following to
get a complete distribution, including all binaries:

@example
   ftp> mget ID-INSTALL
   ftp> mget id-*
@end example

Close the FTP connection:

@example
   ftp> quit
   221 Goodbye.
@end example

Read the @file{ID-INSTALL} file which you just retrieved for
step-by-step installation instructions.

@unnumberedsubsec Q4.7.5: Is there a reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs?

The reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs is
usually one or more of the following:

@enumerate
@item
The package has not been ported to XEmacs.  This will typically happen
when it uses GNU-Emacs-specific features, which make it fail under
XEmacs.

Porting a package to XEmacs can range from a trivial amount of change to
a partial or full rewrite.  Fortunately, the authors of modern packages
usually choose to support both Emacsen themselves.

@item
The package has been decided not to be appropriate for XEmacs.  It may
have an equivalent or better replacement within XEmacs, in which case
the developers may choose not to burden themselves with supporting an
additional package.

Each package bundled with XEmacs means more work for the maintainers,
whether they want it or not.  If you are ready to take over the
maintenance responsibilities for the package you port, be sure to say
so---we will more likely include it.

@item
The package simply hasn't been noted by the XEmacs development.  If
that's the case, the messages like yours are very useful for attracting
our attention.

@item
The package was noted by the developers, but they simply haven't yet
gotten around to including/porting it.  Wait for the next release or,
even better, offer your help.  It will be gladly accepted and

optimizations and safety features appropriate to those environments.

It is also possible to transparently edit files via FTP, ssh, or rsh.  That
is, XEmacs makes a local copy using the transport in the background, and
automatically refreshes the remote original from that copy when you save
it.  XEmacs also is capable of doing file system manipulations like
creating and removing directories and files.  The FTP interface is
provided by the standard @samp{efs} package @ref{Top, EFS, , efs}.  The

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.0.5: How can I get XEmacs to come up in text/auto-fill mode by default?

Try the following lisp in your @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
(setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
@end lisp

@strong{WARNING}: note that changing the value of
@code{default-major-mode} from @code{fundamental-mode} can break a large
amount of built-in code that expects newly created buffers to be in
@code{fundamental-mode}.  (Changing from @code{fundamental-mode} to
@code{text-mode} might not wreak too much havoc, but changing to
something more exotic like a lisp-mode would break many Emacs packages).

Note that Emacs by default starts up in buffer @code{*scratch*} in
@code{initial-major-mode}, which defaults to
@code{lisp-interaction-mode}. Thus adding the following form to your
Emacs init file will cause the initial @code{*scratch*} buffer to be put
into auto-fill'ed @code{text-mode}:

@lisp
(setq initial-major-mode
      (lambda ()
        (text-mode)
        (turn-on-auto-fill)))
@end lisp

Note that after your init file is loaded, if
@code{inhibit-startup-message} is @code{nil} (the default) and the
startup buffer is @code{*scratch*} then the startup message will be
inserted into @code{*scratch*}; it will be removed after a timeout by
erasing the entire @code{*scratch*} buffer.  Keep in mind this default
usage of @code{*scratch*} if you desire any prior manipulation of
@code{*scratch*} from within your Emacs init file. In particular,
anything you insert into @code{*scratch*} from your init file will be
later erased. Also, if you change the mode of the @code{*scratch*}
buffer, be sure that this will not interfere with possible later
insertion of the startup message (e.g. if you put @code{*scratch*} into
a nonstandard mode that has automatic font lock rules, then the startup
message might get fontified in a strange foreign manner, e.g. as code in
some programming language).

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.1: What is the difference in key sequences between XEmacs and GNU Emacs?

@email{clerik@@naggum.no, Erik Naggum} writes;

@quotation
Emacs has a legacy of keyboards that produced characters with modifier
bits, and therefore map a variety of input systems into this scheme even
today.  XEmacs is instead optimized for X events.  This causes an
incompatibility in the way key sequences are specified, but both Emacs
and XEmacs will accept a key sequence as a vector of lists of modifiers
that ends with a key, e.g., to bind @kbd{M-C-a}, you would say
@code{[(meta control a)]} in both Emacsen.  XEmacs has an abbreviated
form for a single key, just (meta control a).  Emacs has an abbreviated
form for the Control and the Meta modifiers to string-characters (the
ASCII characters), as in @samp{\M-\C-a}.  XEmacs users need to be aware
that the abbreviated form works only for one-character key sequences,
while Emacs users need to be aware that the string-character is rather
limited.  Specifically, the string-character can accommodate only 256
different values, 128 of which have the Meta modifier and 128 of which
have not.  In each of these blocks, only 32 characters have the Control
modifier.  Whereas @code{[(meta control A)]} differs from @code{[(meta
control a)]} because the case differs, @samp{\M-\C-a} and @samp{\M-\C-A}
do not.  Programmers are advised to use the full common form, both
because it is more readable and less error-prone, and because it is
supported by both Emacsen.
@end quotation

Another (even safer) way to be sure of the key-sequences is to use the
@code{read-kbd-macro} function, which takes a string like @samp{C-c
<up>}, and converts it to the internal key representation of the Emacs
you use.  The function is available both on XEmacs and GNU Emacs.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.2: Can I generate "fake" keyboard events?

I wonder if there is an interactive function that can generate
@dfn{fake} keyboard events.  This way, I could simply map them inside
XEmacs.

This seems to work:

@lisp
(defun cg--generate-char-event (ch)
  "Generate an event, as if ch has been typed"
  (dispatch-event (character-to-event ch)))

;;  Backspace and Delete stuff
(global-set-key [backspace]
  (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 127)))
(global-set-key [unknown_keysym_0x4]
  (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 4)))
@end lisp

@node Q5.1.3, Q5.1.4, Q5.1.2, Miscellaneous
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.3: Could you explain @code{read-kbd-macro} in more detail?

The @code{read-kbd-macro} function returns the internal Emacs
representation of a human-readable string (which is its argument).
Thus:

@lisp
(read-kbd-macro "C-c C-a")
@result{} [(control ?c) (control ?a)]

(read-kbd-macro "C-c C-. <up>")
@result{} [(control ?c) (control ?.) up]
@end lisp

In GNU Emacs the same forms will be evaluated to what GNU Emacs
understands internally---the sequences @code{"\C-x\C-c"} and @code{[3
67108910 up]}, respectively.

The exact @dfn{human-readable} syntax is defined in the docstring of
@code{edmacro-mode}.  I'll repeat it here, for completeness.

@quotation
Format of keyboard macros during editing:

Text is divided into @dfn{words} separated by whitespace.  Except for
the words described below, the characters of each word go directly as
characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words is
ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly, as in
@kbd{foo @key{SPC} bar @key{RET}}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The special words @kbd{RET}, @kbd{SPC}, @kbd{TAB}, @kbd{DEL}, @kbd{LFD},
@kbd{ESC}, and @kbd{NUL} represent special control characters.  The
words must be written in uppercase.

@item
A word in angle brackets, e.g., @code{<return>}, @code{<down>}, or
@code{<f1>}, represents a function key.  (Note that in the standard
configuration, the function key @code{<return>} and the control key
@key{RET} are synonymous.)  You can use angle brackets on the words
@key{RET}, @key{SPC}, etc., but they are not required there.

@item
Keys can be written by their @sc{ascii} code, using a backslash followed
by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to represent keys with
codes above \377.

@item
One or more prefixes @kbd{M-} (meta), @kbd{C-} (control), @kbd{S-}
(shift), @kbd{A-} (alt), @kbd{H-} (hyper), and @kbd{s-} (super) may
precede a character or key notation.  For function keys, the prefixes
may go inside or outside of the brackets: @code{C-<down>} @equiv{}
@code{<C-down>}.  The prefixes may be written in any order: @kbd{M-C-x}
@equiv{} @kbd{C-M-x}.

Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., @kbd{C-abc}, except
that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional
minus sign: @kbd{M--123} @equiv{} @kbd{M-- M-1 M-2 M-3}.

@item
The @code{^} notation for control characters also works: @kbd{^M}
@equiv{} @kbd{C-m}.

@item
Double angle brackets enclose command names: @code{<<next-line>>} is
shorthand for @kbd{M-x next-line @key{RET}}.

@item
Finally, @code{REM} or @code{;;} causes the rest of the line to be
ignored as a comment.
@end itemize

Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal number
and @code{*}: @code{3*<right>} @equiv{} @code{<right> <right> <right>},
and @code{10*foo} @equiv{}
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@code{foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo}.

Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word, but
you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one of the
above notations: @code{; ; ;} is a keyboard macro with three semicolons,
but @code{;;;} is a comment.  Likewise, @code{\ 1 2 3} is four keys but
@code{\123} is a single key written in octal, and @code{< right >} is
seven keys but @code{<right>} is a single function key.  When in doubt,
use whitespace.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.5: What is the recommended use of @code{setq}?

@itemize @bullet
@item Global variables

You will typically @code{defvar} your global variable to a default
value, and use @code{setq} to set it later.

It is never a good practice to @code{setq} user variables (like
@code{case-fold-search}, etc.), as it ignores the user's choice
unconditionally.  Note that @code{defvar} doesn't change the value of a
variable if it was bound previously.  If you wish to change a
user-variable temporarily, use @code{let}:

@lisp
(let ((case-fold-search nil))
  ...                                   ; code with searches that must be case-sensitive
  ...)
@end lisp

You will notice the user-variables by their docstrings beginning with an
asterisk (a convention).

@item Local variables

Bind them with @code{let}, which will unbind them (or restore their
previous value, if they were bound) after exiting from the @code{let}
form.  Change the value of local variables with @code{setq} or whatever
you like (e.g. @code{incf}, @code{setf} and such).  The @code{let} form
can even return one of its local variables.

Typical usage:

@lisp
;; iterate through the elements of the list returned by
;; `hairy-function-that-returns-list'
(let ((l (hairy-function-that-returns-list)))
  (while l
    ... do something with (car l) ...
    (setq l (cdr l))))
@end lisp

Another typical usage includes building a value simply to work with it.

@lisp
;; Build the mode keymap out of the key-translation-alist
(let ((inbox (file-truename (expand-file-name box)))
      (i 0))
  ... code dealing with inbox ...
  inbox)
@end lisp

This piece of code uses the local variable @code{inbox}, which becomes
unbound (or regains old value) after exiting the form.  The form also
returns the value of @code{inbox}, which can be reused, for instance:

@lisp
(setq foo-processed-inbox
      (let .....))
@end lisp
@end itemize

@node Q5.1.6, Q5.1.7, Q5.1.5, Miscellaneous
@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.6: What is the typical misuse of @code{setq} ?

A typical misuse is probably @code{setq}ing a variable that was meant to
be local.  Such a variable will remain bound forever, never to be
garbage-collected.  For example, the code doing:

@lisp
(defun my-function (whatever)
  (setq a nil)
  ... build a large list ...
  ... and exit ...)
@end lisp

does a bad thing, as @code{a} will keep consuming memory, never to be
unbound.  The correct thing is to do it like this:

@lisp
(defun my-function (whatever)
  (let (a)                              ; default initialization is to nil
    ... build a large list ...
    ... and exit, unbinding `a' in the process  ...)
@end lisp

Not only is this prettier syntactically, but it makes it possible for
Emacs to garbage-collect the objects which @code{a} used to reference.

Note that even global variables should not be @code{setq}ed without
@code{defvar}ing them first, because the byte-compiler issues warnings.
The reason for the warning is the following:

@lisp
(defun flurgoze nil)                    ; ok, global internal variable
...

(setq flurghoze t)                      ; ops!  a typo, but semantically correct.
                                        ; however, the byte-compiler warns.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.7: I like the @code{do} form of cl, does it slow things down?

It shouldn't.  Here is what Dave Gillespie has to say about cl.el
performance:

@quotation
Many of the advanced features of this package, such as @code{defun*},
@code{loop}, and @code{setf}, are implemented as Lisp macros.  In
byte-compiled code, these complex notations will be expanded into
equivalent Lisp code which is simple and efficient.  For example, the
forms

@lisp
(incf i n)
(push x (car p))
@end lisp

are expanded at compile-time to the Lisp forms

@lisp
(setq i (+ i n))
(setcar p (cons x (car p)))
@end lisp

which are the most efficient ways of doing these respective operations
in Lisp.  Thus, there is no performance penalty for using the more
readable @code{incf} and @code{push} forms in your compiled code.

@emph{Interpreted} code, on the other hand, must expand these macros
every time they are executed.  For this reason it is strongly
recommended that code making heavy use of macros be compiled.  (The
features labelled @dfn{Special Form} instead of @dfn{Function} in this
manual are macros.)  A loop using @code{incf} a hundred times will
execute considerably faster if compiled, and will also garbage-collect
less because the macro expansion will not have to be generated, used,
and thrown away a hundred times.

You can find out how a macro expands by using the @code{cl-prettyexpand}
function.

slowness comes from internal mechanisms such as redisplay, or from the
fact that it is an interpreter.

Please try not to make your code much uglier to gain a very small speed
gain.  It's not usually worth it.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.9: How do I put a glyph as annotation in a buffer?

Here is a solution that will insert the glyph annotation at the
beginning of buffer:

@lisp
(make-annotation (make-glyph '([FORMAT :file FILE]
                               [string :data "fallback-text"]))
                 (point-min)
                 'text
                 (current-buffer))
@end lisp

Replace @samp{FORMAT} with an unquoted symbol representing the format of
the image (e.g. @code{xpm}, @code{xbm}, @code{gif}, @code{jpeg}, etc.)
Instead of @samp{FILE}, use the image file name
(e.g.
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@file{/usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.4/etc/recycle.xpm}).

You can turn this to a function (that optionally prompts you for a file
name), and inserts the glyph at @code{(point)} instead of
@code{(point-min)}.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.1.10: @code{map-extents} won't traverse all of my extents!

I tried to use @code{map-extents} to do an operation on all the extents
in a region.  However, it seems to quit after processing a random number
of extents.  Is it buggy?

No.  The documentation of @code{map-extents} states that it will iterate
across the extents as long as @var{function} returns @code{nil}.
Unexperienced programmers often forget to return @code{nil} explicitly,
which results in buggy code.  For instance, the following code is
supposed to delete all the extents in a buffer, and issue as many
@samp{fubar!} messages.

@lisp
(map-extents (lambda (ext ignore)
               (delete-extent ext)
               (message "fubar!")))
@end lisp

Instead, it will delete only the first extent, and stop right there --
because @code{message} will return a non-nil value.  The correct code
is:

@lisp
(map-extents (lambda (ext ignore)
               (delete-extent ext)
               (message "fubar!")
               nil))

[Many of] These files have an (erroneous) 24byte header that tells about

probably possible to fix the header by piping through @code{sox} and

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.3.1: How do you make XEmacs indent CL if-clauses correctly?

I'd like XEmacs to indent all the clauses of a Common Lisp @code{if} the
same amount instead of indenting the 3rd clause differently from the
first two.

One way is to add, to @file{init.el}/@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(put 'if 'lisp-indent-function nil)
@end lisp

However, note that the package @code{cl-indent} that comes with
XEmacs sets up this kind of indentation by default.  @code{cl-indent}
also knows about many other CL-specific forms.  To use @code{cl-indent},
one can do this:

@lisp
(load "cl-indent")
(setq lisp-indent-function (function common-lisp-indent-function))
@end lisp

One can also customize @file{cl-indent.el} so it mimics the default
@code{if} indentation @code{then} indented more than the @code{else}.
Here's how:

@lisp
(put 'if 'common-lisp-indent-function '(nil nil &body))
@end lisp

Also, a new version (1.2) of @file{cl-indent.el} was posted to
comp.emacs.xemacs on 12/9/94.  This version includes more documentation
than previous versions.  This may prove useful if you need to customize
any indent-functions.

@unnumberedsubsec Q5.3.5: How do I specify the paths that XEmacs uses for finding files?

You can specify what paths to use by using a number of different flags
when running configure.  See the section MAKE VARIABLES in the top-level
file INSTALL in the XEmacs distribution for a listing of those flags.

Most of the time, however, the simplest fix is: @strong{do not} specify
paths as you might for GNU Emacs.  XEmacs can generally determine the
necessary paths dynamically at run time.  The only path that generally
needs to be specified is the root directory to install into.  That can
be specified by passing the @code{--prefix} flag to configure.  For a
description of the XEmacs install tree, please consult the @file{NEWS}

Since this is XEmacs, you can specify an icon to be shown on

something like this:

@lisp
(make-glyph '([xpm :file "~/something.xpm"]

Yes, abbrevs only expands word-syntax strings. While XEmacs does not
prevent you from defining (e.g. with @kbd{C-x a g} or @kbd{C-x a l})
abbrevs that contain special characters, it will refuse to expand
them. So you need to ensure, that the abbreviation contains letters and
digits only. This means that @samp{xd}, @samp{d5}, and @samp{5d} are
valid abbrevs, but @samp{&d}, and @samp{x d} are not.

Firstly there is an ftp site which describes X-faces and has the
associated tools mentioned below, at
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/faces/}.

Then the steps are

@enumerate
@item
Create 48x48x1 bitmap with your favorite tool

@item
Convert to "icon" format using one of xbm2ikon, pbmtoicon, etc.,
and then compile the face.

@item
@example
cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon |compface > file.face
@end example

@item
Then be sure to quote things that are necessary for emacs strings:

@example
cat ./file.face | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g'
@iftex
\ @*
@end iftex
| sed 's/\"/\\\"/g' > ./file.face.quoted
@end example

@item
Then set up emacs to include the file as a mail header - there were a
couple of suggestions here---either something like:

@lisp
(setq  mail-default-headers
       "X-Face:  @email{Ugly looking text string here}")
@end lisp

Or, alternatively, as:

@lisp
(defun mail-insert-x-face ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (search-forward mail-header-separator)
    (beginning-of-line)
    (insert "X-Face:")
    (insert-file-contents "~/.face")))

(add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'mail-insert-x-face)
@end lisp
@end enumerate

However, 2 things might be wrong:

Some versions of pbmtoicon produces some header lines that is not
expected by the version of compface that I grabbed. So I found I had to
include a @code{tail +3} in the pipeline like this:

@example
cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon | tail +3 |compface > file.face
@end example

Some people have also found that if one uses the @code{(insert-file)}
method, one should NOT quote the face string using the sed script .

It might also be helpful to use @email{stig@@hackvan.com, Stig's} script
(included in the compface distribution at XEmacs.org) to do the
conversion.
@comment For convenience xbm2xface is available for anonymous FTP at
@comment @uref{ftp://ftp.miranova.com/pub/xemacs/xbm2xface.pl}.

@item
Use @code{Info-default-directory-list} to initialize

Emacs Info looks for a standard @file{dir} file in each of the

@item
XEmacs Info looks for a @file{localdir} file (which consists of just the
menu entries from a @file{dir} file) in each of the directories scanned
from #1 (except the first), does a simple concatenation of them, and
magically attaches the resulting list to the end of the menu in the

For regular printing there are two variables that can be customized.

This should be set to a command that takes standard input and sends
it to a printer.  Something like:

@lisp
(setq lpr-command "lp")

This should be set to a list that contains whatever the print command
requires to do its job.  Something like:

@lisp
(setq lpr-switches '("-depson"))
@end lisp
@end table

For postscript printing there are three analogous variables to
customize.

@table @code
@item ps-lpr-command
This should be set to a command that takes postscript on standard input
and directs it to a postscript printer.

@item ps-lpr-switches
This should be set to a list of switches required for
@code{ps-lpr-command} to do its job.

@item ps-print-color-p
This boolean variable should be set @code{t} if printing will be done in
color, otherwise it should be set to @code{nil}.
@end table

NOTE: It is an undocumented limitation in XEmacs that postscript
printing (the @code{Pretty Print Buffer} menu item) @strong{requires} a
window system environment.  It cannot be used outside of X11.

@unnumberedsec 6.0: General Info
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.1: What is the status of the XEmacs port to Windows?

Is XEmacs really ported to MS Windows?  What is the status of the port?

Beginning with release 21.0, XEmacs has worked under MS Windows.  A
group of dedicated developers actively maintains and improves the
Windows-specific portions of the code.  The mailing list at
@email{xemacs-nt@@xemacs.org} is dedicated to that effort (please use
the -request address to subscribe). (Despite its name, XEmacs actually
works on all versions of Windows.)

As of May 2001, XEmacs on MS Windows is stable and full-featured, and
has been so for a year or more -- in fact, some features, such as
printing, actually work better on Windows than native Unix.  However,
the internationalization (Mule) support does not work -- although this
is being actively worked on.


@node Q6.0.2, Q6.0.3, Q6.0.1, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.2: What flavors of MS Windows are supported?  The list name implies NT only.

The list name is misleading, as XEmacs supports and has been compiled on
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows
XP, and all newer versions of Windows.  The MS Windows-specific code is
based on Microsoft Win32 API, and will not work on MS Windows 3.x or on
MS-DOS.

XEmacs also supports the Cygwin and MinGW development and runtime
environments, where it also uses native Windows code for graphical
features.


@node Q6.0.3, Q6.0.4, Q6.0.2, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.3: Are binaries available?

Binaries are available at @uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/}

version of 21.1.

The 21.4 binaries use a modified version of the Cygwin installer.  Run
the provided @file{setup.exe}, and follow the instructions.


@node Q6.0.4, Q6.0.5, Q6.0.3, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.4: Can I build XEmacs on MS Windows with X support?  Do I need to?

Yes, you can, but no you do not need to.  In fact, we recommend that you
use a native-GUI version unless you have a specific need for an X
version.

@node Q6.0.5, Q6.0.6, Q6.0.4, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.5: I'd like to help out.  What do I do?

It depends on the knowledge and time you possess.  If you are a
programmer, try to build XEmacs and see if you can improve it.
Windows-specific improvements like integration with established
Windows environments are especially sought after.

Otherwise, you can still help by downloading the binaries, using
XEmacs as your everyday editor and reporting bugs you find to the
mailing list.

Another area where we need help is the documentation: We need good
documentation for building XEmacs and for using it.  This FAQ is a
small step in that direction.

@node Q6.0.6, Q6.0.7, Q6.0.5, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.6: What are Cygwin and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?

To answer the second part of the question: No, you, you don't need
Cygwin or MinGW to build or to run XEmacs.  But if you have them and
want to use them, XEmacs supports these environments.

(One important reason to support Cygwin is that it lets the MS Windows
developers test out their code in a Unix environment without actually
having to have a Unix machine around.  For this reason alone, Cygwin
support is likely to remain supported for a long time in XEmacs.  Same
goes for the X support under Cygwin, for the same reasons.  MinGW
support, on the other hand, depends on volunteers to keep it up to date;
but this is generally not hard.)

Cygwin is a set of tools providing Unix-like API on top of Win32.
It makes it easy to port large Unix programs without significant
changes to their source code.  It is a development environment as well
as a runtime environment.

When built with Cygwin, XEmacs supports all display types -- TTY, X &
Win32 GUI, and can be built with support for all three simultaneously.
If you build with Win32 GUI support then the Cygwin version uses the
majority of the Windows-specific code, which is mostly related to
display.  If you want to build with X support you need X libraries (and
an X server to display XEmacs on); see @ref{Q6.1.4}.  TTY and Win32 GUI
require no additional libraries beyond what comes standard with Cygwin.

The advantages of the Cygwin version are that it integrates well with
the Cygwin environment for existing Cygwin users; uses configure so
building with different features is very easy; and actively supports X &
TTY.  Furthermore, the entire Cygwin environment and compiler are free,
whereas Visual C++ costs money.

The disadvantage is that it requires the whole Cygwin environment,
whereas the native port requires only a suitable MS Windows compiler.
Also, it follows the Unix filesystem and process model very closely
(some will undoubtedly view this as an advantage).

See @uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/} for more information on
Cygwin.

MinGW is a collection of header files and import libraries that allow
one to use GCC under the Cygwin environment to compile and produce
exactly the same native Win32 programs that you can using Visual C++.
Programs compiled with MinGW make use of the standard Microsoft runtime
library @file{MSVCRT.DLL}, present on all Windows systems, and look,
feel, and act like a standard Visual-C-produced application. (The only
difference is the compiler.) This means that, unlike a
standardly-compiled Cygwin application, no extra runtime support
(e.g. Cygwin's @file{cygwin1.dll}) is required.  This, along with the
fact that GCC is free (and works in a nice Unix-y way in a nice Unix-y
environment, for those die-hard Unix hackers out there), is the main
advantage of MinGW.  It is also potentially faster than Cygwin because
it has less overhead when calling Windows, but you lose the POSIX
emulation layer, which makes Unix programs harder to port. (But this is
irrelevant for XEmacs since it's already ported to Win32.)

See @uref{http://www.mingw.org/} for more information on MinGW.

@node Q6.0.7, Q6.1.1, Q6.0.6, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.0.7: What exactly are all the different ways to build XEmacs under Windows?

XEmacs can be built in several ways in the MS Windows environment.

The standard way is what we call the "native" port.  It uses the Win32
API and has no connection with X whatsoever -- it does not require X
libraries to build, nor does it require an X server to run.  The native
port is the most reliable version and provides the best graphical
support.  Almost all development is geared towards this version, and
there is little reason not to use it.

The second way to build is the Cygwin port.  It takes advantage of
Cygnus emulation library under Win32.  @xref{Q6.0.6}, for more
information.

A third way is the MinGW port.  It uses the Cygwin environment to build
but does not require it at runtime.  @xref{Q6.0.6}, for more
information.

Finally, you might also be able to build the non-Cygwin, non-MinGW "X"
port.  This was actually the first version of XEmacs that ran under MS
Windows, and although the code is still in XEmacs, it's essentially
orphaned and it's unlikely it will compile without a lot of work.  If
you want an MS Windows versin of XEmacs that supports X, use the Cygwin
version. (The X support there is actively maintained, so that Windows
developers can test the X support in XEmacs.)

You need Visual C++ 4.2, 5.0, or 6.0 for the native version. (We have
some beta testers currently trying to compile with VC.NET, aka version
7.0, but we can't yet report complete success.) For the Cygwin and MinGW

You can find the Cygwin tools and compiler at:

Click on the @samp{Install now!} link, which will download a file
@file{setup.exe}, which you can use to download everything else. (You
will need to pick a mirror site; @samp{mirrors.rcn.net} is probably the
best.) You should go ahead and install everything -- you'll get various
ancillary libraries that XEmacs needs or likes, e.g. XPM, PNG, JPEG,
TIFF, etc.

If you want to compile under X, you will also need the X libraries; see
@ref{Q6.1.6}.

If you want to compile without X, you will need the @file{xpm-nox}
library, which must be specifically selected in the Cygwin netinstaller;
it is not selected by default.  The package has had various names.
Currently it is called @file{cygXpm-noX4.dll}.

Some problems to watch out for:

@itemize @bullet
@item
make sure HOME is set. This controls where you
@file{init.el}/@file{.emacs} file comes from;

@item
CYGWIN needs to be set to tty for process support to work, e.g. CYGWIN=tty;

@item
picking up some other grep or other UNIX-like tools can kill configure;

@item
static heap too small, adjust @file{src/sheap-adjust.h} to a more positive
number;

@item
(Unconfirmed) The Cygwin version doesn't understand
@file{//machine/path} type paths so you will need to manually mount a
directory of this form under a unix style directory for a build to work
on the directory;

@item
If you're building @strong{WITHOUT} X11, don't forget to change symlinks
@file{/usr/lib/libXpm.a} and @file{/usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a} to point to
the non-X versions of these libraries.  By default they point to the X
versions.  So:

@example
/usr/lib/libXpm.a     -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.a
/usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.dll.a
@end example

(This advice may now be obsolete because of the availability of the
cygXpm-noX4.dll package from Cygwin.  Send confirmation to

@unnumberedsubsec Q6.1.6: I decided to run with X.  Where do I get an X server?

As of May 2001, we are recommending that you use the port of XFree86 to
Cygwin.  This has recently stabilized, and will undoubtedly soon make
most other MS Windows X servers obsolete.  It is what the Windows
developers use to test the MS Windows X support.

To install, go to @uref{http://xfree86.cygwin.com/}.  There is a
detailed description on that site of exactly how to install it.  This
installation also provides the libraries, include files, and other stuff
needed for development; a large collection of internationalized fonts;
the standard X utilities (xterm, twm, etc.) -- in a word, the works.

NOTE: As of late May 2001, there is a bug in the file
@file{startxwin.bat}, used to start X Windows.  It passes the option
@samp{-engine -4} to the X server, which is bogus -- you need to edit
the file and change it to @samp{-engine 4}.


@node Q6.1.7, Q6.2.1, Q6.1.6, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.1.7: How do I compile with X support?

To compile under Cygwin, all you need to do is install XFree86
(@pxref{Q6.1.6}).  Once installed, @file{configure} should automatically
find the X libraries and compile with X support.

As noted above, the non-Cygwin X support is basically orphaned, and
probably won't work.  But if it want to try, it's described in
@file{nt/README} in some detail.  Basically, you need to get X11
libraries from ftp.x.org, and compile them.  If the precompiled versions
are available somewhere, we don't know of it.

@unnumberedsubsec Q6.2.1: How does the port cope with differences in the Windows user interface?

The XEmacs (and Emacs in general) user interface is pretty different
from what is expected of a typical MS Windows program.  How does the MS
Windows port cope with it?

As a general rule, we follow native MS Windows conventions as much as
possible.  21.4 is a fairly complete Windows application, supporting
native printing, system file dialog boxes, tool tips, etc.  In cases
where there's a clear UI conflict, we currently use normal Unix XEmacs
behavior by default, but make sure the MS Windows "look and feel" (mark
via shift-arrow, self-inserting deletes region, Alt selects menu items,
etc.) is easily configurable (respectively: using the variable
@code{shifted-motion-keys-select-region} in 21.4 and above [it's in fact
the default in these versions], or the @file{pc-select} package; using
the @file{pending-del} package; and setting the variable
@code{menu-accelerator-enabled} to @code{menu-force} in 21.4 and above).
In fact, if you use the sample @file{init.el} file as your init file,
you will get all these behaviors automatically turned on.

In future versions, some of these features might be turned on by
default in the MS Windows environment.

In 21.4 and above, you can use the "Options" menu to change the font.
You can also do it in your init file, e.g. like this:

    (set-face-font 'default "Lucida Console:Regular:10")
    (set-face-font 'modeline "MS Sans Serif:Regular:10")

@file{init.el} is the name of the init file starting with 21.4, and is
located in the subdirectory @file{.xemacs/} of your home directory.  In
prior versions, the init file is called @file{.emacs} and is located in
your home directory.  Your home directory under Windows is determined by
the @samp{HOME} environment variable.  If this is not set, it defaults to

@unnumberedsubsec Q6.3.1: Does XEmacs rename all the @samp{win32-*} symbols to @samp{w32-*}?

In his flavor of Emacs 20, Richard Stallman has renamed all the @samp{win32-*}
symbols to @samp{w32-*}.  Does XEmacs do the same?

We consider such a move counter-productive, thus we do not use the
@samp{w32} prefix. (His rather questionable justification was that he
did not consider Windows to be a "winning" platform.) However, the name
@samp{Win32} is not particularly descriptive outside the Windows world,
and using just @samp{windows-} would be too generic.  So we chose a
compromise, the prefix @samp{mswindows-} for Windows-related variables
and functions.

Thus all the XEmacs variables and functions directly related to either
the Windows GUI or OS are prefixed @samp{mswindows-} (except for a
couple of debugging variables, prefixed @samp{debug-mswindows-}).  From
an architectural perspective, however, we believe that this is mostly a
non-issue because there should be a very small number of
window-systems-specific variables anyway.  Whenever possible, we try to
provide generic interfaces that apply to all window systems.

@c not true:

@c that share functionality with existing NT Emacs variables are be named

@itemize @bullet

@item
XEmacs

@itemize @minus

@item
Beginning with XEmacs 19.12, XEmacs' architecture was redesigned
in such a way to allow clean support of multiple window systems.  At
this time the TTY support was added, making X and TTY the first two
"window systems" supported by XEmacs.  The 19.12 design is the basis for
the current native MS Windows code.

@item
Some time during 1997, David Hobley (soon joined by Marc Paquette)
imported some of the NT-specific portions of GNU Emacs, making XEmacs
with X support compile under Windows NT, and creating the "X" port.

@item
Several months later, Jonathan Harris sent out initial patches to use
the Win32 API, thus creating the native port.  Since then, various
people have contributed, including Kirill M. Katsnelson (contributed
support for menubars, subprocesses and network, as well as loads of
other code), Andy Piper (ported XEmacs to Cygwin environment,
contributed Windows unexec, Windows-specific glyphs and toolbars code,
and more), Ben Wing (loads of improvements; primary MS Windows developer
since 2000), Jeff Sparkes (contributed scrollbars support) and many
others.
@end itemize

@item
NT Emacs

@itemize @minus

@item
NT Emacs is a version of GNU Emacs modified to compile and run under MS
Windows 95 and NT using the native Win32 API.  As such, it is close in
spirit to the XEmacs "native" port.

@item
NT Emacs has been written by Geoff Voelker, and more information can be
found at
@iftex
@*
@end iftex
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html}.

@item
Win-Emacs

@itemize @minus

@item
Win-Emacs was a port of Lucid Emacs 19.6 to MS Windows using X
compatibility libraries.  Win-Emacs was written by Ben Wing.  The MS
Windows code never made it back to Lucid Emacs, and its creator (Pearl
Software) has long since gone out of business.
@end itemize

@item
GNU Emacs for DOS

@itemize @minus

@item
GNU Emacs features support for MS-DOS and DJGPP (D.J. Delorie's DOS
port of GCC).  Such an Emacs is heavily underfeatured, because it does
not support long file names, lacks proper subprocesses support, and
is far too big compared with typical DOS editors.
@end itemize

@item
GNU Emacs compiled with Win32

@itemize @minus

@item
Starting with version 19.30, it has been possible to compile GNU Emacs
under MS Windows using the DJGPP compiler and X libraries.  The result
is very similar to GNU Emacs compiled under MS DOS, only it works
somewhat better because it runs in 32-bit mode, makes use of all the
system memory, supports long file names, etc.

@node Q6.3.3, Q6.3.4, Q6.3.2, MS Windows
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.3.3: XEmacs 21.1 on Windows used to spawn an ugly console window on every startup.  Has that been fixed?

Yes.

The console was there because @file{temacs} (and in turn, @file{xemacs})
was a console application, and Windows typically creates a new
console for a console process unless the creating process requests that
one isn't created.  This used to be fixed with @file{runemacs}, a small
Windows application that existed merely to start @file{xemacs}, stating
that it didn't want a console.

XEmacs 21.4 fixes this cleanly by the virtue of being a true "GUI"
application.  The explanation of what that means is included for
educational value.

When building an application to be run in a Win32 environment, you must
state which sub-system it is to run in.  Valid subsystems include
"console" and "gui".  The subsystem you use affects the run time
libraries linked into your application, the start up function that is
run before control is handed over to your application, the entry point
to your program, and how Windows normally invokes your program. (Console
programs automatically get a console created for them at startup if
their stdin/stdout don't point anywhere useful, which is the case when
run from the GUI.  This is a stupid design, of course -- instead, the
console should get created only when the first I/O actually occurs!
GUI programs have an equally stupid design: When called from
@file{CMD.EXE}/@file{COMMAND.COM}, their stdin/stdout will be set to
point nowhere useful, even though the command shell has its own
stdin/stdout.  It's as if someone who had learned a bit about stdio but
had no actual knowledge of interprocess communication designed the
scheme; unfortunately, the whole process-communication aspect of the
Win32 API is equally badly designed.) For example, the entry point for a
console app is "main" (which is what you'd expect for a C/C++ program),
but the entry point for a "gui" app is "WinMain".  This confuses and
annoys a lot of programmers who've grown up on Unix systems, where the
kernel doesn't really care whether your application is a gui program or
not.

For reasons not altogether clear, and are lost in the mists of time and
tradition, XEmacs on Win32 started out as a console application, and
therefore a console was automatically created for it. (It may have been
made a console application partly because a console is needed in some
circumstances, especially under Win95, to interrupt, terminate, or send
signals to a child process, and because of the bogosity mentioned above
with GUI programs and the standard command shell.  Currently, XEmacs
just creates and immediately hides a console when necessary, and
works around the "no useful stdio" problem by creating its own console
window as necessary to display messages in.)

@unnumberedsec 6.3: Troubleshooting
@unnumberedsubsec Q6.4.1 XEmacs won't start on Windows.

XEmacs relies on a process called "dumping" to generate a working
executable. Under MS-Windows this process effectively fixes the memory
addresses of information in the executable. When XEmacs starts up it tries
to reserve these memory addresses so that the dumping process can be
reversed -- putting the information back at the correct addresses.
Unfortunately some .DLLs (for instance the soundblaster driver) occupy
memory addresses that can conflict with those needed by the dumped XEmacs
executable. In this instance XEmacs will fail to start without any
explanation. Note that this is extremely machine specific.

21.1.10 includes a fix for this that makes more intelligent guesses
about which memory addresses will be free, and this should cure the
problem for most people.  21.4 implements "portable dumping", which
eliminates the problem altogether.  We recommend you use the 21.4

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.0.2: What's new in XEmacs 21.4?

21.4 was the "stable" version of the 21.2 series, which was considered
"experimental" throughout its life; thus there were no "official"
releases at all.  In essence, XEmacs is now following the "alternating"
scheme of Linux, where at any point there are at least two different
development branches, one "stable" and one "experimental".  Periodic
releases happen in both branches, but those in the experimental branch
are not tested as well, and there's no guarantee they will work at all.
The experiemental branch is open to any and all code that's acceptable
to the developers; the stable branch, however, is in general limited
only to bug fixes, and all contributions are carefully reviewed to make
sure they will increase and not decrease stability.

21.3 never existed at all; it was decided to follow the Linux scheme
exactly, where odd-numbered series are experimental and even-numbered
ones stable.

The following lists summarizes the essential changes made in this
version.  For a fuller list, see the @file{NEWS} in the @file{etc}

prevents any attempt to permanently change the selected frame; new
function @code{focus-frame} sets the window system focus a frame; new
special forms @code{save-selected-frame} and @code{with-selected-frame}.

@item
@strong{Window function changes}: @code{select-window} now has optional
argument @var{NORECORD} to inhibit recording a buffer change;

@unnumberedsubsec Q7.0.4: What's new in XEmacs 20.4?

XEmacs 20.4 is a bugfix release with no user-visible changes.
@c Filled in from NEWS file of 20.5-b33

@node Q7.0.5, Q7.0.6, Q7.0.4, Current Events
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.0.5: What's new in XEmacs 20.3?

XEmacs 20.3 was released in November 1997. It contains many bugfixes,
and a number of new features, including Autoconf 2 based configuration,
additional support for Mule (Multi-language extensions to Emacs), many
more customizations, multiple frames on TTY-s, support for multiple info
directories, an enhanced gnuclient, improvements to regexp matching,
increased MIME support, and many, many synches with GNU Emacs 20.

The XEmacs/Mule support has been only seriously tested in a Japanese
locale, and no doubt many problems still remain.  The support for
ISO-Latin-1 and Japanese is fairly strong.  MULE support comes at a
price---about a 30% slowdown from 19.16.  We're making progress on
improving performance and XEmacs 20.3 compiled without Mule (which is
the default) is definitely faster than XEmacs 19.16.

XEmacs 20.3 is the first non-beta v20 release, and will be the
basis for all further development.

@node Q7.0.6, , Q7.0.5, Current Events
@unnumberedsubsec Q7.0.6: What's new in XEmacs 20.2?

The biggest changes in 20.2 include integration of EFS (the next
generation of ange-ftp) and AUC Tex (the Emacs subsystem that includes a
major mode for editing Tex and LaTeX, and a lot of other stuff).  Many
bugs from 20.0 have been fixed for this release.  20.2 also contains a
new system for customizing XEmacs options, invoked via @kbd{M-x
customize}.

XEmacs 20.2 is the development release (20.0 was beta), and is no longer
considered unstable.

For older news, see the file @file{ONEWS} in the @file{etc} directory of
the XEmacs distribution.

@unnumbered 8 New information about old XEmacsen

This is part 8 of the XEmacs Frequently Asked Questions list.  It will
occasionally be updated to reflect new information about versions which
are no longer being revised by the XEmacs Project.  The primary purpose
is advice on compatibility of older XEmacsen with new packages and
updated versions of packages, but bug fixes (which will not be applied
to released XEmacsen, but users can apply themselves) are also accepted.

Previously I wrote:

    Eric> Summary: with Gnus 5.10.1 in XEmacs 21.1.14, I don't see
    Eric> any smileys :-(.

After a bit of sleuthing, I discovered the essence of the problem.
For me, the form:

@lisp
    	(with-temp-buffer
    	  (insert-file-contents "foo.xpm")
    	  (buffer-string))
@end lisp

returns the empty string.  This is because something somewhere
replaces the XPM data with a glyph --- I haven't figured out where
this occurs.

@email{kyle_jones@@wonderworks.com, Kyle Jones} replies:

@quotation
Do this:

@lisp
    (setq format-alist nil)
@end lisp

The image-mode stuff is gone from format-alist in the 21.4
branch, praise be.
