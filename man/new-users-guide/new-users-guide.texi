@top The Emacs Editor


Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.  This Info file will help you get started on using 
XEmacs.  It corresponds to XEmacs version 19.13.

@unnumbered Preface

  This guide is intended to help you get started on using the
Emacs editor. It will show you some examples of simple customizations.

  For detailed information on any topic, refer to the @b{XEmacs
User's Manual}. This document will also refer the reader to the
@b{XEmacs User's Manual} for more information on corresponding
topics. You can also use the on-line, learn-by-doing tutorial, which you
get by running Emacs and typing @kbd{C-h t} OR you can choose the
@b{Emacs Tutorial} from the @b{Help} menu on the menu bar (which is
located on the extreme right of the frame). With it, you learn Emacs by
using Emacs on a specially designed file which describes commands, tells
you when to try them, and then explains the results you see.

  The first few chapters will introduce you to some basic Emacs commands. 
Later on, some examples of simple customizations will be shown. 

  To find the documentation on a particular command, look in the index.
Keys (character commands) and command names have separate indexes.  There
is also a glossary, with a cross reference for each term.

  This manual comes in two forms: the published form and the Info form.
The Info form is for on-line perusal with the INFO program; it is
distributed along with XEmacs.  Both forms contain substantially the
same text and are generated from a common source file, which is also
distributed along with XEmacs.

@unnumbered Introduction

  You are reading about XEmacs which is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor.

  XEmacs is a @dfn{display} editor because normally the text
being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as you
type.  @xref{Frame,Display,,xemacs,XEmacs User's Manual}.

  It is a @dfn{real-time} editor because the display is updated very
frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you type.
This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your head as
you edit.  @xref{Basic,Real-time,Basic Editing,xemacs,XEmacs User's
Manual}.

  It is advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond
simple insertion and deletion: filling of text; automatic indentation of
programs; viewing two or more files at once; and dealing in terms of
characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as
expressions and comments in several different programming languages.  It is
much easier to type one command meaning ``go to the end of the paragraph''
than to find that spot with simple cursor keys.

  @dfn{Self-documenting} means that at any time you can type a special
character, @kbd{Control-h}, to find out what your options are.  You can
also use @kbd{C-h} to find out what a command does, or to find all the
commands relevant to a topic.  @xref{Help,,,xemacs,XEmacs User's Manual}.

  @dfn{Customizable} means you can change the definitions of Emacs
commands.  For example, if you use a programming language in which
comments start with @samp{<**} and end with @samp{**>}, you can tell the
Emacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings
(@pxref{Comments,,,xemacs,XEmacs User's Manual}).  Another sort of
customization is rearrangement of the command set.  For example, you can
set up the four basic cursor motion commands (up, down, left and right)
on keys in a diamond pattern on the keyboard if you prefer.
@xref{Customization,,,xemacs,XEmacs User's Manual}.

  @dfn{Extensible} means you can go beyond simple customization and
write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language to be run by
Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an ``on-line extensible''
system: it is divided into many functions that call each other.  You can
redefine any function in the middle of an editing session and replace
any part of Emacs without making a separate copy of all of Emacs.  Most
of the editing commands of Emacs are written in Lisp; the few
exceptions could have been written in Lisp but are written in C for
efficiency.  Only a programmer can write an extension to Emacs, but anybody
can use it afterward.
