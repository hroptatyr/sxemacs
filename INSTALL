SXEmacs Installation Guide
Copyright (C) 2005 - 2008 Steve Youngs


Building from tarball release: 
-----------------------------
(See "Building from arch source" below if you got SXEmacs that way)

In a nutshell:
-------------
See ./configure --help for a description of all possible options,
then

  $ ./configure [options]
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


Prerequisites:
-------------
Your version of SXEmacs includes a file called `PROBLEMS' in the top
directory of the source tarball.  Please take a moment now to look
over it.

GNU make.  Solaris make and BSD make just don't cut the mustard, so
make sure you use GNU make (sometimes installed as `gmake').  If you
don't have it, you can leech it from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make

To build SXEmacs you need a C compiler that is C99 compliant.  We
recommend GCC >= 3.1.1.  Other compilers _may_ work, such as Intel's
ICC, but the SXEmacs project won't explicitly support any compiler
other than GCC.  If you don't have such a compiler you can get GCC
from: http://gcc.gnu.org/.

Please note that SXEmacs _CANNOT_ be built with a C++ compiler.

Also, some configuration options may need external libraries that are
not shipped with SXEmacs.  SXEmacs will determine which libraries it
needs at configuration time (when you run `./configure').

If configure can't find a particular library and you _do_ have it
installed, you can usually get configure to find it by adding to the
`--with-site-prefixes' option.

There are several optional external libraries you may use to extend
the feature-range of SXEmacs.  See section `Optional Libraries'.


Stripping:
---------
Our advice... _DON'T_ do it.  Stripping object files doesn't buy you
anything other than a little bit of drive space.  And in an era where
200 Gigabyte hard disks are common, the space saved by stripping is
inconsequential at best.

But that isn't the only reason why we suggest that you don't strip
SXEmacs.  If you did, any bug reports you sent us would be useless
because the backtrace from any core dump wouldn't contain any useful
information.

Another reason for not stripping comes from the complexity of SXEmacs
and how it is built.  SXEmacs first compiles to a basic binary
(sometimes called "temacs"), and then it loads in a pile of lisp code
and other goodies, and dumps itself out to become the finished SXEmacs
binary.  Add into that mix, the portable dumper (where a lot of stuff
for sxemacs actually resides _outside_ of the binary in a dump file)
and it becomes apparent that stripping may not even be possible.  What
do you strip? temacs? the portable dump file? sxemacs binary?

Err on the side of caution and don't even try it.


Compiler Optimisations:
----------------------
Considerable care has been taken to ensure that the maximum safe
compiler optimisation flags have been turned on by default.  If you
wish to use your own flags, that's OK, but understand that sometimes
over-optimising (especially with something as complex as SXEmacs) can
actually have an adverse affect.


Packages:
--------
Like XEmacs, SXEmacs only comes with a minimal set of lisp libraries
to cover only basic editing and functions.  To get fuller
functionality you need to install some extra elisp packages.  SXEmacs
doesn't actually distribute any elisp packages, but it can and does
use XEmacs packages.

Unlike XEmacs, SXEmacs does _NOT_ need any packages pre-installed
before its packaging tools (PUI) are usable.  To install elisp
packages into a virgin, packageless, SXEmacs, follow these steps...

  1) Start SXEmacs

  2) From the menubar, choose:

	  Tools -> Packages -> Set Download Site -> Official Releases
	    -> ...

  3) M-x pui-bootstrap RET

After the "bootstrapping" is finished you'll be asked if you want to
install anymore packages.


File hierarchies:
----------------
As of 22.1.6 SXEmacs installs its files in a LFSH-compliant (Linux
FileSystem Hierarchy) way.  Here is a small table:

         now go to...                before went to...
lisp     share/sxemacs-$ver/lisp/  lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/lisp/
etc      share/sxemacs-$ver/etc/   lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/etc/
info     share/info/                 lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/info/
headers  include/sxemacs/$ver/     lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/<arch>/include/

The only thing that remained are modules which are located at
lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/<arch>/modules.  Which is already FSH std
anyway.

Optional Libraries:
------------------
Optional libraries enhance your SXEmacs with additional features.  Since
most of the added features are not mandatory for the core SXEmacs, we
decided to make them optional.  That is, you can - but do not need to -
install them and incorporate them into SXEmacs.

  Failure to detect optional libraries:
  -------------------------------------
  If the optional libraries are in a non-standard location, use
  --with-site-prefixes option of configure. Ex:

	./configure --with-site-prefixes=/opt/local

  You can specify a list of paths with --with-site-prefixes:

  	./configure --with-site-prefixes=/opt/local:/sw

  NOTE: Usage of --prefix does NOT imply that it is added to
  site prefixes, so if you may need to add --with-site-prefixes
  even with --prefix:
	
	./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-site-prefixes=/opt/local



  Multimedia Libraries:
  --------------------
  In order to use MM features you need libraries which are responsible
  for handling different types of media files, that is parses them,
  demuxes them and decodes them to a raw form suitable for your audio
  hardware.  We call such libs multimedia libraries.

  Note: To get multimedia working you also have to install at least one
  audio output library.  See next section.

  - sndfile:
    http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

  - ffmpeg:
    http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/

  - mad:
    http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/

  - SoX:
    http://sox.sourceforge.net/

  Note: Some of the media libraries above may in turn have dependencies
  to even lower level libraries.  Consult the documentation of the
  respective project.

  The configure option to control media libraries is --with-media.  It
  defaults to `all'.


  Audio Output Libraries:
  ----------------------
  The other type of libraries for SXEmacs multimedia features cares for
  the actual audio output, that is takes some raw audio data and feeds
  it to your speakers (or somewhere else).  We call those Audio Output
  Libraries.

  - OSS (Open Sound System): native on Linux and BSD. DEPRECATED!

  - NAS (Network Audio System):
    http://nas.codebrilliance.com/

  - ESD (Enlightenment Sound Daemon):
    ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/esound/0.2/

  - PulseAudio:
    http://pulseaudio.org/

  - aRts (Analog Realtime Synthesizer):
    http://www.arts-project.org/

  - Jack (Jack Audio Connection Kit):
    http://jackit.sourceforge.net/

  - ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture): Linux-only
    http://www.alsa-project.org/

  - AO: generic and portable audio output
    http://www.xiph.org/ao/

  Note: Some of the audio libraries above may in turn have dependencies
  to even lower level libraries.  Consult the documentation of the
  respective project.

  The configure option to control media libraries is --with-sound.  It
  defaults to `all'.


  Image Decoding Libraries:
  ------------------------
  For image media, SXEmacs provides support for various standard formats.
  We call those Image Format Libraries.

  - GIF: built-in, i.e. no extra library necessary

  - XPM (X PixMap format): included in the X distribution, see for one
    http://www.x.org 

  - PNG (Portable Network Graphic):
    http://www.libpng.org/

  - JPEG:
    http://www.ijg.org/

  - TIFF:
    http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/

  - xface (base64 encoded xbm):
    http://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/compface-1.5.1.tar.gz

  The configure option to control media libraries is --with-image.  It
  defaults to `all'.


  Additional Number Types:
  -----------------------
  SXEmacs can extend its arithmetics enormously by using external
  support.  We refer to enhanced number types as ENT.

  - GMP (GNU MultiPrecision arithmetics library):
    http://swox.com/gmp

  - BSD mp:
    Available natively on BSD distributions.  Also included in the
    OpenSSL distribution.

  - MPFR (Multi-Precision Floating point numbers with correct Rounding):
    http://www.mpfr.org

  - MPC (Multi-Precision Complex numbers):
    http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Andreas.Enge/mpc/mpc.html

  The configure option to control ENT libraries is --with-ent.  It
  defaults to `all'.


  Foreign Function Interface:
  --------------------------
  Foreign functions open the world to any library on your system.
  Download a source tarball from:

    <ftp://sourceware.org/pub/libffi/>.

  Or grab the latest CVS sources with:

    cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/libffi login
       (password is ``anoncvs'')
    cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/libffi co libffi

  FFI is also available as part of GCC.  It gets turned on if you
  build the Java compiler, gcj.  Strangely enough, not very many Linux
  distros do this by default.  Building GCC can take literally hours,
  building libffi from sourceware takes literally seconds... I know
  which I'd rather do.

  There is also a section about FFI in the PROBLEMS file, so check
  that out if you are having any trouble.

  The configure option for the FFI support is --with-ffi.  It defaults
  to `yes'.


  OpenSSL interface:
  -----------------
  SXEmacs supports cryptographic algorithms and security protocols via
  the OpenSSL toolkit.  To make use of it build and install any version
  since 0.9.8.
  http://www.openssl.org/

  The configure option for OpenSSL support is --with-openssl which
  defaults to `yes'.


  PostgreSQL Support:
  ------------------
  SXEmacs can interact with databases managed by the PostgreSQL DBMS.
  The functionality roughly corresponds to that of the libpq interface.
  http://www.postgresql.org/

  The configure option for PgSQL support is --with-postgresql and
  defaults to `autodetect'.


The build failed:
----------------
Advise 1:
Don't panic.  Take a look at the PROBLEMS file first and see if your
issue is listed there.

Advise 2:
If the build fails at the configure script, try to examine the output
and/or the more verbose config.log.  If the culprit seems to be a
certain test or configure option, try to circumvent it.  You can for one
disable almost any functionality using --without-<feature>.

Advise 3:
If the build fails at the make stage somewhere, try to figure out which
functionality was attempted to make.  If it appears to be at some of the
optional features, try configuring again with that option disabled.  If
it seems to be a compiler or linker problem read advise number 4.

Advise 4:
If the build fails and you have absolutely no clue why it does, contact
the friendly people at SXEmacs.  For almost real-time help consider the
IRC channel 
  #sxemacs on freenode  irc://irc.freenode.net/#sxemacs

If you cannot stand real-time help you can try the
  SXEmacs developers mailing list  sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org

Unfortunately, because of spam issues, the SXEmacs mailing lists are
all "member only".  This means that if you are not subscribed, it'll
go to the moderator.  Our moderator is a very busy guy and he has to
filter through more spam than you can poke a stick at... occasionally
things can slip through the cracks.  Your best bet is to subscribe to
the lists.  We are truly sorry for this inconvenience.

Be sure to keep anything that could help to track the problem down, in
particular that is:
- configure output
- config.log
- make output
- core dump files if any
- your OS and machine architecture
- the steps you have done

Before submitting a report at http://issues.sxemacs.org/, please show
up either on the mailing list or the IRC channel.  The developers can
tell you in much greater detail what they need and how you can get the
files and information you need.


Building from arch source:
-------------------------
This is identical to building from the tarball sources, with the
addition of an extra step, and some extra requirements (that are most
likely already on your system).

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure [options]
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

Extra requirements:
------------------
The SXEmacs sources in the arch repo do not contain _any_ generated
files.  You will need recent versions of the GNU autotools (automake,
autoconf).

You need at least...

  automake 1.9.4
  autoconf 2.60

Warnings from autogen.sh:
------------------------
You may notice several warnings from running the autogen.sh script.
They can be safely ignored unless it dies completely or a configure
script isn't generated.

The two most common warnings seen are...

  Warnings about underquoting of macros in /usr/share/aclocal/foo.m4

    These are because recent versions of aclocal have become more strict
    about quoting and you have some older style macros defined like:
    AC_DEFUN(NAME, ...) instead of AC_DEFUN([NAME], ...).

  Warnings about ETAGS variable being redifined

    These are because automake has a pre-defined ETAGS target that
    projects can use, unfortunately it doesn't fit in with our needs,
    and isn't easily customisable.  So we wrote our own ETAGS Makefile
    target.
