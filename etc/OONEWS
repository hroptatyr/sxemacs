* Introduction
==============

This file presents some general information about XEmacs.  It is primarily
about the evolution of XEmacs and its release history.

There are five sections.

    Introduction................(this section) provides an introduction

    Using Outline Mode..........briefly explains how to use outline mode

    XEmacs Release Notes........detailed changes to this release

    Future Plans for XEmacs.....what's next

    The History of XEmacs.......some historical notes

    A Long List of Packages.....all the stuff in XEmacs

    What Changed................between versions and also FSF GNU Emacs

New users should look at the next section on "Using Outline Mode".
You will be more efficient when you can navigate quickly through this
file.  Users who want to know which capabilities have been introduced
in this release should look at the "XEmacs Release Notes."  Users
interested in some of the details of how XEmacs differs from GNU Emacs
should read the section "What Changed?".

    N.B.  The term "FSF GNU Emacs" refers to any release of Emacs
    Version 19 from the Free Software Foundation's GNU Project. (We do
    not say just "GNU Emacs" because Richard M. Stallman ["RMS"]
    thinks that this term is too generic; although we sometimes say
    e.g. "GNU Emacs 19.30" to refer to a specific version of FSF GNU
    Emacs.  The term "XEmacs" refers to this program or to its
    predecessors "Era", "Epoch", and "Lucid Emacs".  The predecessor
    of all these program is called "Emacs 18".  When no particular
    version is implied, "Emacs" will be used.


* Using Outline Mode
====================

This file is in outline mode, a major mode for viewing (or editing)
outlines.  It allows you to make parts of the text temporarily invisible so
that you can see just the overall structure of the outline.

There are two ways of using outline mode:  with keys or with menus.  Using
outline mode with menus is the simplest and is just as effective as using
keystrokes.  There are menus for outline mode on the menubar as well as in
popup menus activated by pressing mouse button 3.

Try the following to help you read this file.

C-c C-q         This hides everything but the very top level headings
                You can then move to an interesting section
C-c TAB         This shows subheadings (if any) of current heading.
C-c C-s         Show _all_ the text and headings under current heading
C-c C-d         Hide _all_ the text and headings under current heading

It's then easy to navigate through the file alternating between
showing, C-C C-s, and hiding, C-c C-d, the text.  Also, use the "Show"
and "Hide" menus displayed to get access to the same commands.
                
You may at any time press `C-h m' to get a listing of the outline mode key
bindings.

* XEmacs Release Notes
======================

** Major Differences Between 19.15 and 19.16

** Major Differences Between 19.14 and 19.15
============================================

Many bugs have been fixed.  An effort has been made to eradicate all
XEmacs crashes, although we are not quite done yet.  The overall
quality of XEmacs should be higher than any previous release.  XEmacs
now compiles with nary a warning with some compilers.

User visible changes:

-- EFS replaces ange-ftp for remote file manipulation capability.

-- TM (Tools for Mime) now comes with XEmacs.  This provides MIME
   (Multi-purpose Internet Multi-media Extensions?) support for Mail
   and News.  The primary author is Morioka Tomohiko.

-- There is a new way to customize faces and (some) variables.
   Try it with `M-x customize RET', or from the Options->Customize menu.
   Documented in <URL:info:custom>.

-- The AUC TeX environment for editing and running TeX is now bundled.
   (Per Abrahamsen.)
   Enable with (require 'tex-site) in your .emacs file.
   Documented in <URL:info:auctex>.

-- New user option `init-face-from-resources'.
   If you don't set faces with X resources, you can speed up the
   initialization of new faces by setting this to nil.

-- `column.el' removed, use `column-number-mode' instead.

-- Command line processing should work much better now - no more order
   dependencies.

-- html mode now defaults to using HTML-3.2

-- VM now has a native MIME mode

-- The traditional time.el package now has optional modeline graphics

-- The XEmacs Logo has been changed courtesy of Jens Lautenbacher

-- Default background changed to gray80

-- The XEmacs build procedure has been changed to make it easier than
   ever to include new packages to be dumped with the binary

-- cc-mode is no longer auto-loaded.  (require 'cc-mode) is now needed
   before you customize cc-mode in your .emacs.

-- blink-cursor-mode is somewhat more useable now that the cursor
   stops blinking during keyboard activity.

-- Dired is now part of efs and went from version 6.X to 7.9.
   Keybindings have been synced with FSF Emacs, there are more menus and
   items in menus are sometimes grouped differently.  Any personnal
   customization to dired will probably have to be checked.

   If you are a 19.14 user and use its dired a lot, expect to get mad at
   'c', 'r' and '^' keybindings."

    a group.

**** Groups inside topics can now be sorted using the standard
sorting functions, and each topic can be sorted independently.

    See the commands under the `T S' submap.

**** Subsets of the groups can be sorted independently.

** Changes at Lisp level
------------

-- New `widget' library for inserting UI components in buffers.
   Documented in <URL:info:widget>.

-- New `custom' library for declaring user options and faces.
   Documented in <URL:info:custom>.

-- New function `make-empty-face'.
   Like `make-face', but doesn't query the resource database.

-- New function x-keysym-on-keyboard-p helps determine keyboard
   characteristics for key rebinding:

  x-keysym-on-keyboard-p: (KEYSYM &optional DEVICE)
    -- a built-in function.
  Return true if KEYSYM names a key on the keyboard of DEVICE.
  More precisely, return true if pressing a physical key
  on the keyboard of DEVICE without any modifier keys generates KEYSYM.
  Valid keysyms are listed in the files /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h and in
  /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB, or whatever the equivalents are on your system.

-- Usage of keysyms of the form kp_0 is deprecated and one should use
   the Emacs compatible kp-0 instead.


-- preceding-char and following-char have been obsoleted.  Use the
   much safer and correct functions char-after and char-before instead.

-- Many symbols present for compatibility with GNU Emacs no longer
   generate bytecompiler warning messages

-- Installed info files are now compressed (support courtesy of Joseph J Nuspl)

-- (load-average) works on Solaris, even if you're not root. Thanks to
   Hrvoje Niksic.

-- OffiX drag-and-drop support added

-- lots of syncing with 19.34 elisp files, most by Steven Baur

-- M-: (eval-expression) is now enabled by default since it is much
   more difficult to type.

-- new variables:
        signal-error-on-buffer-boundary


* Future Plans for XEmacs
==========================

This is the end of the line for XEmacs v19.  No new development is planned
on this source tree.  XEmacs 20.1 will contain the functionality in 19.15,
and development will continue with XEmacs 20.2. The major new `feature'
planned in 20.2 will be the introduction of separable packages and the
capability to download and use an XEmacs lite distribution.

* The History of XEmacs
=======================

This product is an extension of GNU Emacs, previously known to some as
"Lucid Emacs" or "ERA".  It was initially based on an early version of Emacs
Version 19 from the Free Software Foundation and has since been kept
up-to-date with recent versions of that product.  It stems from a
collaboration of Lucid, Inc. with SunSoft DevPro (a division of Sun
Microsystems, Inc.; formerly called SunPro) and the University of Illinois.

NOTE: Lucid, Inc. is currently out of business but development on XEmacs
continues strong.  Recently, Amdahl Corporation and INS Engineering have
both contributed significantly to the development of XEmacs.


* A Long List of Packages
=======================

This section gives a detailed list of packages included with XEmacs.
It's long!  Of particular interest are: games, gnus, modes, packages,
and utils.

** auctex       - Super TeX
*** auctex/auc-old.el
This file contains an alternative keymapping, compatible with
older versions of AUC TeX.  You are strongly suggested to try the
new keyboard layout, as we would like this file to go away
eventually.
*** auctex/bib-cite.el
Commentary:

This package is used in various TeX modes to display or edit references
associated with \cite commands, or matching \ref and \label commands.
*** auctex/font-latex.el
Commentary:
*** auctex/style/german.el
Commentary:

`german.sty' use `"' to give next character an umlaut.
*** auctex/style/harvard.el
Commentary:

Harvard citation style is from Peter Williams available on the CTAN
servers
*** auctex/style/plfonts.el
Commentary:

`plfonts.sty' use `"' to make next character Polish.
`plfonts.sty' <C> L. Holenderski, IIUW, lhol@mimuw.edu.pl
*** auctex/style/plhb.el
Commentary:

`plhb.sty' use `"' to make next character Polish.
`plhb.sty' <C> J. S. Bie\'n, IIUW, jsbien@mimuw.edu.pl


** bytecomp     - Byte compile Emacs Lisp files
*** bytecomp/byte-optimize.el
Commentary:

========================================================================
"No matter how hard you try, you can't make a racehorse out of a pig.
You can, however, make a faster pig."

Or, to put it another way, the emacs byte compiler is a VW Bug.  This code
makes it be a VW Bug with fuel injection and a turbocharger...  You're
still not going to make it go faster than 70 mph, but it might be easier
to get it there.

*** bytecomp/bytecomp-runtime.el
Commentary:

interface to selectively inlining functions.
This only happens when source-code optimization is turned on.
*** bytecomp/bytecomp.el
Commentary:

The Emacs Lisp byte compiler.  This crunches lisp source into a sort
of p-code which takes up less space and can be interpreted faster.
The user entry points are byte-compile-file and byte-recompile-directory.
*** bytecomp/disass.el
Commentary:

The single entry point, `disassemble', disassembles a code object generated
by the Emacs Lisp byte-compiler.  This doesn't invert the compilation
operation, not by a long shot, but it's useful for debugging.

** calendar     - Calendars, diaries and appointments
*** calendar/calendar.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements a calendar window.  It
generates a calendar for the current month, together with the previous
and coming months, or for any other three-month period.  The calendar
can be scrolled forward and backward in the window to show months in
the past or future; the cursor can move forward and backward by days,
weeks, or months, making it possible, for instance, to jump to the
date a specified number of days, weeks, or months from the date under
the cursor.  The user can display a list of holidays and other notable
days for the period shown; the notable days can be marked on the
calendar, if desired.  The user can also specify that dates having
corresponding diary entries (in a file that the user specifies) be
marked; the diary entries for any date can be viewed in a separate
window.  The diary and the notable days can be viewed independently of
the calendar.  Dates can be translated from the (usual) Gregorian
calendar to the day of the year/days remaining in year, to the ISO
commercial calendar, to the Julian (old style) calendar, to the Hebrew
calendar, to the Islamic calendar, to the French Revolutionary calendar,
to the Mayan calendar, and to the astronomical (Julian) day number.
When floating point is available, times of sunrise/sunset can be displayed,
as can the phases of the moon.  Appointment notification for diary entries
is available.
*** calendar/cal-dst.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements the features of calendar.el and
holiday.el that deal with daylight savings time.
*** calendar/cal-french.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements the features of calendar.el and
diary.el that deal with the French Revolutionary calendar.
*** calendar/cal-mayan.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements the features of calendar.el and
diary.el that deal with the Mayan calendar.  It was written jointly by
*** calendar/cal-x.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements dedicated frames in x-windows for
calendar.el.
*** calendar/cal-xemacs.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements menu bar and popup menu support for
calendar.el.
*** calendar/diary-ins.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements the diary insertion features as
described in calendar.el.
*** calendar/solar.el
Commentary:

This collection of functions implements the features of calendar.el,
diary.el, and holiday.el that deal with times of day, sunrise/sunset, and
eqinoxes/solstices.

** cl           - Common Lisp compatibility with Emacs Lisp
*** cl/cl-compat.el
Commentary:

These are extensions to Emacs Lisp that provide a degree of
Common Lisp compatibility, beyond what is already built-in
in Emacs Lisp.

** comint       - For running shells, telnet, rsh, gdb, dbx under Emacs
*** comint/comint-xemacs.el
Commentary:

Declare customizable faces for comint outside the main code so it can
be dumped with XEmacs.
*** comint/comint.el
Commentary:

This file defines a general command-interpreter-in-a-buffer package
(comint mode). The idea is that you can build specific process-in-a-buffer
modes on top of comint mode -- e.g., lisp, shell, scheme, T, soar, ....
This way, all these specific packages share a common base functionality,
and a common set of bindings, which makes them easier to use (and
saves code, implementation time, etc., etc.).

Several packages are already defined using comint mode:
- shell.el defines a shell-in-a-buffer mode.
- cmulisp.el defines a simple lisp-in-a-buffer mode.

- The file cmuscheme.el defines a scheme-in-a-buffer mode.
- The file tea.el tunes scheme and inferior-scheme modes for T.
- The file soar.el tunes lisp and inferior-lisp modes for Soar.
- cmutex.el defines tex and latex modes that invoke tex, latex, bibtex,
  previewers, and printers from within emacs.
- background.el allows csh-like job control inside emacs.
*** comint/gdb.el
Commentary:

A facility is provided for the simultaneous display of the source code
in one window, while using gdb to step through a function in the
other.  A small arrow in the source window, indicates the current
line.
*** comint/gud.el
Commentary:
*** comint/history.el
Commentary:

suggested generic history stuff  -- tale

This is intended to provided easy access to a list of elements
being kept as a history ring.
*** comint/inf-lisp.el
Commentary:

This file defines a a lisp-in-a-buffer package (inferior-lisp
mode) built on top of comint mode.  This version is more
featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.  The
key bindings are also more compatible with the bindings of Hemlock
and Zwei (the Lisp Machine emacs).
*** comint/kermit.el
Commentary:

I'm not sure, but I think somebody asked about running kermit under shell
mode a while ago.  Anyway, here is some code that I find useful.  The result
is that I can log onto machines with primitive operating systems (VMS and
ATT system V :-), and still have the features of shell-mode available for
command history, etc.  It's also handy to be able to run a file transfer in
an emacs window.  The transfer is in the "background", but you can also
monitor or stop it easily.
*** comint/rlogin.el
Commentary:

Support for remote logins using `rlogin'.
This program is layered on top of shell.el; the code here only accounts
for the variations needed to handle a remote process, e.g. directory
tracking and the sending of some special characters.
*** comint/shell.el
Commentary:

This file defines a a shell-in-a-buffer package (shell mode) built
on top of comint mode.  This is actually cmushell with things
renamed to replace its counterpart in Emacs 18.  cmushell is more
featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.
*** comint/telnet.el
Commentary:

This mode is intended to be used for telnet or rsh to a remode host;
`telnet' and `rsh' are the two entry points.  Multiple telnet or rsh
sessions are supported.

** custom       - Allow's user to customize Emacs
*** custom/custom.el
Commentary:

This file only contain the code needed to declare and initialize
user options.  The code to customize options is autoloaded from
`cus-edit.el'.

The code implementing face declarations is in `cus-face.el'

** edebug       - Emacs Lisp debugger
*** edebug/cl-read.el
Commentary:

Please send bugs and comments to the author.

This package replaces the standard Emacs Lisp reader (implemented
as a set of built-in Lisp function in C) by a flexible and
customizable Common Lisp like one (implemented entirely in Emacs
Lisp). During reading of Emacs Lisp source files, it is about 40%
slower than the built-in reader, but there is no difference in
loading byte compiled files - they don't contain any syntactic sugar
and are loaded with the built in subroutine `load'.

** ediff        - Compare and merge files with graphical difference display
*** ediff/ediff.el
Commentary:

Never read that diff output again!
Apply patch interactively!
Merge with ease!

This package provides a convenient way of simultaneous browsing through
the differences between a pair (or a triple) of files or buffers.  The
files being compared, file-A, file-B, and file-C (if applicable) are
shown in separate windows (side by side, one above the another, or in
separate frames), and the differences are highlighted as you step
through them.  You can also copy difference regions from one buffer to
another (and recover old differences if you change your mind).

Ediff also supports merging operations on files and buffers, including
merging using ancestor versions. Both comparison and merging operations can
be performed on directories, i.e., by pairwise comparison of files in those
directories.

** efs          - Remote file access (replaces ange-ftp)
See online manual.

** electric     - The "electric" commands; these implement temporary
windows for help, list-buffers, etc.

*** electric/ehelp.el
Commentary:

This package provides a pre-packaged `Electric Help Mode' for
browsing on-line help screens.  There is one entry point,
`with-electric-help'; all you have to give it is a no-argument
function that generates the actual text of the help into the current
buffer.

** emulators    - Various emulations: mocklisp, teco, TPU/EDT, WordStar
*** emulators/mlconvert.el
Commentary:

This package converts Mocklisp code written under a Gosling or UniPress
Emacs for use with GNU Emacs.  The translated code will require runtime
support from the mlsupport.el equivalent.
*** emulators/mlsupport.el
Commentary:

This package provides equivalents of certain primitives from Gosling
Emacs (including the commercial UniPress versions).  These have an
ml- prefix to distinguish them from native GNU Emacs functions with
similar names.  The package mlconvert.el translates Mocklisp code
to use these names.
*** emulators/teco.el
Commentary:

This code has been tested some, but no doubt contains a zillion bugs.
You have been warned.

Written by Dale R. Worley based on a C implementation by Matt Fichtenbaum.
Please send comments, bug fixes, enhancements, etc. to drw@math.mit.edu.
*** emulators/tpu-edt.el
Commentary:

%% TPU-edt -- Emacs emulating TPU emulating EDT

%% Introduction

   TPU-edt emulates the popular DEC VMS editor EDT (actually, it emulates
   DEC TPU's EDT emulation, hence the name TPU-edt).
*** emulators/tpu-extras.el
Commentary:

 Use the functions defined here to customize TPU-edt to your tastes by
 setting scroll margins and/or turning on free cursor mode.  Here's an
 example for your .emacs file.
*** emulators/ws-mode.el
Commentary:

This emulates WordStar, with a major mode.

** energize     - Interface to now-defunct Lucid's C/C++ integrated
environment XEmacs (nee Lucid Emacs) saw birth explicitly to serve
Energize.

** eos          - SPARCworks

** eterm        - Full terminal emulation under Emacs
*** eterm/term.el
Commentary:

This file defines a general command-interpreter-in-a-buffer package
(term mode). The idea is that you can build specific process-in-a-buffer
modes on top of term mode -- e.g., lisp, shell, scheme, T, soar, ....
This way, all these specific packages share a common base functionality,
and a common set of bindings, which makes them easier to use (and
saves code, implementation time, etc., etc.).
*** eterm/tgud.el
Commentary:

The ancestral gdb.el was by W. Schelter <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>
It was later rewritten by rms.  Some ideas were due to Masanobu.
Grand Unification (sdb/dbx support) by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
The overloading code was then rewritten by Barry Warsaw <bwarsaw@cen.com>,
who also hacked the mode to use comint.el.  Shane Hartman <shane@spr.com>
added support for xdb (HPUX debugger).  Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com>
wrote the GDB command completion code.  Dave Love <d.love@dl.ac.uk>
added the IRIX kluge and re-implemented the Mips-ish variant.
Then hacked by Per Bothner <bothner@cygnus.com> to use term.el.
*** eterm/tshell.el
Commentary:

This file defines a a shell-in-a-buffer package (shell mode) built
on top of term mode.  This is actually cmushell with things
renamed to replace its counterpart in Emacs 18.  cmushell is more
featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.

** games        - blackbox, mines, decipher, doctor, ...
*** games/blackbox.el
Commentary:

The object of the game is to find four hidden balls by shooting rays
into the black box.  There are four possibilities: 1) the ray will
pass thru the box undisturbed, 2) it will hit a ball and be absorbed,
3) it will be deflected and exit the box, or 4) be deflected immediately,
not even being allowed entry into the box.
*** games/conx.el
Commentary:

conx.el: Yet Another Dissociator.

Select a buffer with a lot of text in it.  Say M-x conx-buffer
or M-x conx-region.  Repeat on as many other bodies of text as
you like.

M-x conx will use the word-frequency tree the above generated
to produce random sentences in a popped-up buffer.  It will pause
at the end of each paragraph for two seconds; type ^G to stop it.
*** games/cookie1.el
Commentary:

Support for random cookie fetches from phrase files, used for such
critical applications as emulating Zippy the Pinhead and confounding
the NSA Trunk Trawler.
*** games/decipher.el
Commentary:

This package is designed to help you crack simple substitution
ciphers where one letter stands for another.  It works for ciphers
with or without word divisions.  (You must set the variable
decipher-ignore-spaces for ciphers without word divisions.)
*** games/dissociate.el
Commentary:

The single entry point, `dissociated-press', applies a travesty
generator to the current buffer.  The results can be quite amusing.
*** games/doctor.el
Commentary:

The single entry point `doctor', simulates a Rogerian analyst using
phrase-production techniques similar to the classic ELIZA demonstration
of pseudo-AI.
*** games/flame.el
Commentary:

"Flame" program.  This has a chequered past.
*** games/gomoku.el
Gomoku is a game played between two players on a rectangular board.     Each
player, in turn, marks a free square of its choice. The winner is the first
one to mark five contiguous squares in any direction (horizontally,
vertically or diagonally).

*** games/hanoi.el
Commentary:

Solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle while-U-wait.

The puzzle: Start with N rings, decreasing in sizes from bottom to
top, stacked around a post.  There are two other posts.  Your mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to shift the pile, stacked in its
original order, to another post.
*** games/life.el
Commentary:

A demonstrator for John Horton Conway's "Life" cellular automaton
in Emacs Lisp.  Picks a random one of a set of interesting Life
patterns and evolves it according to the familiar rules.
*** games/mine.el
Commentary:

The object of this classical game is to locate the hidden mines.
To do this, you hit the squares on the game board that do not
contain mines, and you mark the squares that do contain mines.
*** games/mpuz.el
Commentary:

When this package is loaded, `M-x mpuz' generates a random multiplication
puzzle.  This is a multiplication example in which each digit has been
consistently replaced with some letter.  Your job is to reconstruct
the original digits.  Type `?' while the mode is active for detailed help.
*** games/spook.el
Commentary:

 Just before sending mail, do M-x spook.
 A number of phrases will be inserted into your buffer, to help
 give your message that extra bit of attractiveness for automated
 keyword scanners.
*** games/studly.el
Commentary:

Functions to studlycapsify a region, word, or buffer.  Possibly the
esoteric significance of studlycapsification escapes you; that is,
you suffer from autostudlycapsifibogotification.  Too bad.
*** games/yow.el
Commentary:

Important pinheadery for GNU Emacs.

See cookie1.el for implementation.  Note --- the `n' argument of yow
from the 18.xx implementation is no longer; we only support *random*
random access now.

** gnus         - The ultimate News and Mail reader
See online manual
*** gnus/gnus-audio.el
Commentary:
This file provides access to sound effects in Gnus.
Prerelease:  This file is partially stripped to support earcons.el
You can safely ignore most of it until Red Gnus.  **Evil Laugh**
*** gnus/gnus-gl.el
Commentary:
*** gnus/gnus-undo.el
Commentary:

This package allows arbitrary undoing in Gnus buffers.  As all the
Gnus buffers aren't very text-oriented (what is in the buffers is
just some random representation of the actual data), normal Emacs
undoing doesn't work at all for Gnus.
*** gnus/mailheader.el
Commentary:

This package provides an abstraction to RFC822-style messages, used in
mail news, and some other systems.  The simple syntactic rules for such
headers, such as quoting and line folding, are routinely reimplemented
in many individual packages.  This package removes the need for this
redundancy by representing message headers as association lists,
offering functions to extract the set of headers from a message, to
parse individual headers, to merge sets of headers, and to format a set
of headers.
*** gnus/message.el
Commentary:

This mode provides mail-sending facilities from within Emacs.  It
consists mainly of large chunks of code from the sendmail.el,
gnus-msg.el and rnewspost.el files.
*** gnus/nnheader.el
Commentary:

These macros may look very much like the ones in GNUS 4.1.  They
are, in a way, but you should note that the indices they use have
been changed from the internal GNUS format to the NOV format.  The
makes it possible to read headers from XOVER much faster.

** hm--html-menus - Menus and popups for writing/viewing html documents

** hyperbole    - Personal database

** ilisp        - A comint-based package for interacting with inferior
lisp processes.


** iso          - Implement various ISO character standards
*** iso/iso-acc.el
Commentary:

Function `iso-accents-mode' activates a minor mode in which
typewriter "dead keys" are emulated.  The purpose of this emulation
is to provide a simple means for inserting accented characters
according to the ISO-8859-1 character set.
*** iso/iso-ascii.el
Commentary:

This code sets up to display ISO 8859/1 characters on plain
ASCII terminals.  The display strings for the characters are
more-or-less based on TeX.
*** iso/iso-cvt.el
Commentary:

This lisp code serves two purposes, both of which involve
the translation of various conventions for representing European
character sets to ISO 8859-1.

Commentary:

NAMING: "arc" is short for "archive" and does not refer specifically
to files whose name end in ".arc"

ARCHIVE TYPES: Currently only the archives below are handled, but the
structure for handling just about anything is in place.

*** modes/asm-mode.el
Commentary:

This minor mode is based on text mode.  It defines a private abbrev table
that can be used to save abbrevs for assembler mnemonics.
*** modes/auto-show.el
Commentary:

This file provides functions that
automatically scroll the window horizontally when the point moves
off the left or right side of the window.
*** modes/awk-mode.el
Commentary:

Sets up C-mode with support for awk-style #-comments and a lightly
hacked syntax table.
*** modes/bib-mode.el
Commentary:

  GNU Emacs code to help maintain databases compatible with (troff)
  refer and lookbib.  The file bib-file should be set to your
  bibliography file.  Keys are automagically inserted as you type,
  and appropriate keys are presented for various kinds of entries.
*** modes/bibtex.el
*** modes/cc-compat.el
Commentary:

Boring old c-mode.el (BOCM) is confusion and brain melt. cc-mode.el
is clarity of thought and purity of chi. If you are still unwilling
to accept enlightenment, this might help, or it may prolong your
agony.
*** modes/cc-guess.el
Commentary:

This file contains routines that help guess the cc-mode style in a
particular region of C, C++, or Objective-C code.  It is provided
for example and experimentation only.  It is not supported in
anyway.  Some folks have asked for a style guesser and the best way
to show my thoughts on the subject is with this sample code.  Feel
free to improve upon it in anyway you'd like.  Please send me the
results.  Note that style guessing is lossy!
*** modes/cc-lobotomy.el
Commentary:

Every effort has been made to improve the performance of
cc-mode. However, due to the nature of the C, C++, and Objective-C
language definitions, a trade-off is often required between
accuracy of construct recognition and speed. I believe it is always
best to be correct, and that the mode is currently fast enough for
most normal usage.  Others disagree.  I have no intention of
including these hacks in the main distribution.  When cc-mode
version 5 comes out, it will include a rewritten indentation engine
so that performance will be greatly improved automatically.  This
was not included in this release of version 4 so that Emacs 18
could still be supported.  Note that this implies that cc-mode
version 5 will *not* work on Emacs 18!
*** modes/cc-mode.el
Commentary:

This package provides modes in GNU Emacs for editing C, C++,
Objective-C, and Java code. It is intended to be a replacement for
c-mode.el (a.k.a. BOCM -- Boring Old C-Mode), c++-mode.el,
cplus-md.el, and cplus-md1.el, all of which are in some way
ancestors of this file.  A number of important improvements have
been made, briefly: complete K&R C, ANSI C, `ARM' C++, Objective-C,
and Java support with consistent indentation across all modes, more
intuitive indentation controlling variables, compatibility across
all known Emacsen, nice new features, and tons of bug fixes.  This
package is called "CC Mode" to distinguish it from its ancestors,
but there is no cc-mode command.  Usage and programming details are
contained in an accompanying texinfo manual.
*** modes/cl-indent.el
Commentary:

This package supplies a single entry point, common-lisp-indent-function,
which performs indentation in the preferred style for Common Lisp code.
*** modes/cperl-mode.el Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/eiffel3.el    Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/enriched.el   Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/executable.el
Commentary:

executable.el is used by certain major modes to insert a suitable
#! line at the beginning of the file, if the file does not already
have one.

*** modes/f90.el
Commentary:

Smart mode for editing F90 programs in FREE FORMAT.
Knows about continuation lines, named structured statements, and other
new features in F90 including HPF (High Performance Fortran) structures.
The basic feature is to provide an accurate indentation of F90 programs.
In addition, there are many more features like automatic matching of all
end statements, an auto-fill function to break long lines, a join-lines
function which joins continued lines etc etc.
 To facilitate typing, a fairly complete list of abbreviations is provided.
   For example, `i is short-hand for integer (if abbrev-mode is on).

*** modes/follow.el
Commentary:

`Follow mode' is a minor mode for Emacs 19 and XEmacs which
combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a "virtual window" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

 * The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)

 * Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.
*** modes/fortran.el
Commentary:

Fortran mode has been upgraded and is now maintained by Stephen A. Wood
(saw@cebaf.gov).  It now will use either fixed format continuation line
markers (character in 6th column), or tab format continuation line style
(digit after a TAB character.)  A auto-fill mode has been added to
automatically wrap fortran lines that get too long.

We acknowledge many contributions and valuable suggestions by
Lawrence R. Dodd, Ralf Fassel, Ralph Finch, Stephen Gildea,
Dr. Anil Gokhale, Ulrich Mueller, Mark Neale, Eric Prestemon,
Gary Sabot and Richard Stallman.
*** modes/hideif.el
Commentary:

Hide-ifdef suppresses the display of code that the preprocessor wouldn't
pass through.  The support of constant expressions in #if lines is
limited to identifiers, parens, and the operators: &&, ||, !, and
"defined".  Please extend this.
*** modes/hideshow.el
Commentary:

This file provides `hs-minor-mode'.  When active, six commands:
  hs-{hide,show}-{all,block}, hs-show-region and hs-minor-mode
are available.  They implement block hiding and showing.  Blocks are
defined in mode-specific way.  In c-mode or c++-mode, they are simply
curly braces, while in lisp-ish modes they are parens.  Multi-line
comments (c-mode) can also be hidden.  The command M-x hs-minor-mode
toggles the minor mode or sets it (similar to outline minor mode).
See documentation for each command for more info.
*** modes/icon.el
Commentary:

A major mode for editing the Icon programming language.
*** modes/ksh-mode.el


Description:
  sh, ksh, and bash script editing commands for emacs.

  This major mode assists shell script writers with indentation
  control and control structure construct matching in much the same
  fashion as other programming language modes. Invoke describe-mode
  for more information.
*** modes/lisp-mnt.el
Commentary:

This minor mode adds some services to Emacs-Lisp editing mode.

First, it knows about the header conventions for library packages.
One entry point supports generating synopses from a library directory.
Another can be used to check for missing headers in library files.
*** modes/lisp-mode.el
Commentary:

The base major mode for editing Lisp code (used also for Emacs Lisp).
This mode is documented in the Emacs manual
*** modes/m4-mode.el
Commentary:

A smart editing mode for m4 macro definitions.  It seems to have most of the
syntax right (sexp motion commands work, but function motion commands don't).
It also sets the font-lock syntax stuff for colorization
*** modes/mail-abbrevs.el       Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/make-mode.el
Commentary:

A major mode for editing makefiles.  The mode knows about Makefile
syntax and defines M-n and M-p to move to next and previous productions.

A major mode for editing Modula-2 code.  It provides convenient abbrevs
for Modula-2 keywords, knows about the standard layout rules, and supports
a native compile command.
*** modes/nroff-mode.el
Commentary:

This package is a major mode for editing nroff source code.  It knows
about various nroff constructs, ms, mm, and me macros, and will fill
and indent paragraphs properly in their presence.  It also includes
a command to count text lines (excluding nroff constructs), a command
to center a line, and movement commands that know how to skip macros.
*** modes/old-c-mode.el
Commentary:

A smart editing mode for C code.  It knows a lot about C syntax and tries
to position the cursor according to C layout conventions.  You can
change the details of the layout style with option variables.  Load it
and do M-x describe-mode for details.
*** modes/outl-mouse.el Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/outline.el
Commentary:

This package is a major mode for editing outline-format documents.
An outline can be `abstracted' to show headers at any given level,
with all stuff below hidden.  See the Emacs manual for details.

Emacs should enter Pascal mode when you find a Pascal source file.
When you have entered Pascal mode, you may get more info by pressing
C-h m. You may also get online help describing various functions by:
C-h f <Name of function you want described>
*** modes/perl-mode.el
*** modes/picture.el
Commentary:

This code provides the picture-mode commands documented in the Emacs
manual.  The screen is treated as a semi-infinite quarter-plane with
support for rectangle operations and `etch-a-sketch' character
insertion in any of eight directions.

about Prolog syntax and comments, and can send regions to an inferior
Prolog interpreter process.
*** modes/python-mode.el
Commentary:

This is a major mode for editing Python programs.  It was developed
by Tim Peters after an original idea by Michael A. Guravage.  Tim
subsequently left the net; in 1995, Barry Warsaw inherited the
mode and is the current maintainer.
*** modes/rexx-mode.el  Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/rsz-minibuf.el
Commentary:

This package allows the entire contents (or as much as possible) of the
minibuffer to be visible at once when typing.  As the end of a line is
reached, the minibuffer will resize itself.  When the user is done
typing, the minibuffer will return to its original size.
*** modes/scheme.el
Commentary:

Adapted from Lisp mode by Bill Rozas, jinx@prep.
Initially a query replace of Lisp mode, except for the indentation
of special forms.  Probably the code should be merged at some point
so that there is sharing between both libraries.
*** modes/scribe.el     Can't find any Commentary section
*** modes/sendmail.el
Commentary:

This mode provides mail-sending facilities from within Emacs.  It is
documented in the Emacs user's manual.

similar to those used by the less(1) program are used.
*** modes/view.el
Commentary:

This package provides the `view' minor mode documented in the Emacs
user's manual.

XEmacs: We don't autoload this because we use `view-less' instead.
*** modes/vrml-mode.el
Commentary:

Mostly bastardized from tcl.el.
*** modes/whitespace-mode.el
Commentary:

        This is a minor mode, which highlights whitespaces (blanks and
        tabs) with different faces, so that it is easier to
        distinguish between them.
        Toggle the mode with: M-x whitespace-mode
        or with: M-x whitespace-incremental-mode
        The second one should be used in big files.

normally bound to C-x C-b.
*** packages/chistory.el
Commentary:

This really has nothing to do with list-command-history per se, but
its a nice alternative to C-x ESC ESC (repeat-complex-command) and
functions as a lister if given no pattern.  It's not important
enough to warrant a file of its own.

*** packages/fast-lock.el
Commentary:

Lazy Lock mode is a Font Lock support mode.
It makes visiting a file in Font Lock mode faster by restoring its face text
properties from automatically saved associated Font Lock cache files.

To use, `M-x gopher'.  To specify a different root server, use
`C-u M-x gopher'.  If you want to use bookmarks, set the variable
gopher-support-bookmarks appropriately.
*** packages/hexl.el
Commentary:

This package implements a major mode for editing binary files.  It uses
a program called hexl, supplied with the GNU Emacs distribution, that
can filter a binary into an editable format or from the format back into
binary.  For full instructions, invoke `hexl-mode' on an empty buffer and
do `M-x describe-mode'.
*** packages/hyper-apropos.el
Commentary:

 Rather than run apropos and print all the documentation at once,
 I find it easier to view a "table of contents" first, then
 get the details for symbols as you need them.
*** packages/icomplete.el
Commentary:

Loading this package implements a more fine-grained minibuffer
completion feedback scheme.  Prospective completions are concisely

Commentary:
*** packages/jka-compr.el
Commentary:

This package implements low-level support for reading, writing,
and loading compressed files.  It hooks into the low-level file
I/O functions (including write-region and insert-file-contents) so
that they automatically compress or uncompress a file if the file
appears to need it (based on the extension of the file name).
Packages like Rmail, VM, GNUS, and Info should be able to work
with compressed files without modification.
*** packages/lazy-lock.el
Commentary:

Purpose:

To make visiting buffers in `font-lock-mode' faster by making fontification
be demand-driven and stealthy.
Fontification only occurs when, and where, necessary.
*** packages/ledit.el
Commentary:

This is a major mode for editing Liszt.  See etc/LEDIT for details.

are `lpr-buffer', `print-buffer', lpr-region', or `print-region'; option
variables include `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'.
*** packages/makeinfo.el
Commentary:

The Texinfo mode `makeinfo' related commands are:
*** packages/makesum.el
Commentary:

Displays a nice human-readable summary of all keybindings in a
two-column format.
*** packages/man.el     Can't find any Commentary section
*** packages/metamail.el
Commentary:

Note: Metamail does not have all options which is compatible with
the environment variables.  For that reason, matamail.el have to
hack the environment variables.  In addition, there is no way to
display all header fields without extra informative body messages
which are suppressed by "-q" option.

The idea of using metamail to process MIME messages is from
gnus-mime.el by Spike <Spike@world.std.com>.

  This package highlights matching parens (or whole sexps) for easier
  editing of source code, particularly lisp source code.
*** packages/pending-del.el     Can't find any Commentary section
*** packages/ps-print.el
Commentary:

This package provides printing of Emacs buffers on PostScript
printers; the buffer's bold and italic text attributes are
preserved in the printer output.  Ps-print is intended for use with
Emacs 19 or Lucid Emacs, together with a fontifying package such as
font-lock or hilit.
*** packages/rcompile.el
Commentary:

This package is for running a remote compilation and using emacs to parse
the error messages. It works by rsh'ing the compilation to a remote host
and parsing the output. If the file visited at the time remote-compile was
called was loaded remotely (ange-ftp), the host and user name are obtained
by the calling ange-ftp-ftp-name on the current directory. In this case the
next-error command will also ange-ftp the files over. This is achieved
automatically because the compilation-parse-errors function uses
default-directory to build it's file names. If however the file visited was
loaded locally, remote-compile prompts for a host and user and assumes the
files mounted locally (otherwise, how was the visited file loaded).

*** packages/refbib.el
Commentary:

*** packages/remote.el  Can't find any Commentary section
*** packages/reportmail.el      Can't find any Commentary section
*** packages/resume.el
Commentary:

The purpose of this library is to handle command line arguments
when you resume an existing Emacs job.

You can't get the benefit of this library by using the `emacs' command,
since that always starts a new Emacs job.  Instead you must use a
command called `edit' which knows how to resume an existing Emacs job
if you have one, or start a new Emacs job if you don't have one.

To define the `edit' command, run the script etc/emacs.csh (if you use CSH),
or etc/emacs.bash if you use BASH.  You would normally do this in your
login script.

*** packages/saveplace.el
Commentary:

Automatically save place in files, so that visiting them later
(even during a different Emacs session) automatically moves point
to the saved position, when the file is first found.  Uses the
value of buffer-local variable save-place to determine whether to
save position or not.

Commentary:

If you put a time stamp template anywhere in the first 8 lines of a file,
it can be updated every time you save the file.  See the top of
time-stamp.el for a sample.  The template looks like one of the following:
    Time-stamp: <>
    Time-stamp: " "
The time stamp is written between the brackets or quotes, resulting in
    Time-stamp: <95/01/18 10:20:51 gildea>
*** packages/time.el
Commentary:

Facilities to display current time/date and a new-mail indicator
in the Emacs mode line.  The single entry point is `display-time'.
*** packages/uncompress.el
Commentary:

This package can be used to arrange for automatic uncompress of
files packed with the UNIX compress(1) utility when they are visited.
All that's necessary is to load it.  This can conveniently be done from
your .emacs file.
*** packages/underline.el
Commentary:

This package deals with the primitive form of underlining
consisting of prefixing each character with "_\^h".  The entry
point `underline-region' performs such underlining on a region.
The entry point `ununderline-region' removes it.

*** packages/vc.el
Commentary:

This mode is fully documented in the Emacs user's manual.

Supported version-control systems presently include SCCS, RCS, and CVS.
The RCS lock-stealing code doesn't work right unless you use RCS 5.6.2
or newer.  Currently (January 1994) that is only a beta test release.
Even initial checkins will fail if your RCS version is so old that ci
doesn't understand -t-; this has been known to happen to people running
NExTSTEP 3.0.

*** pcl-cvs/cookie.el
Commentary:

    Introduction
    ============

Cookie is a package that implements a connection between an
dll (a doubly linked list) and the contents of a buffer.
Possible uses are dired (have all files in a list, and show them),
buffer-list, kom-prioritize (in the LysKOM elisp client) and
others.  pcl-cvs.el uses cookie.el.
*** pcl-cvs/dll-debug.el
Commentary:

This is a plug-in replacement for dll.el.  It is dreadfully
slow, but it facilitates debugging.  Don't trust the comments in
this file too much.
(provide 'dll)

*** pcl-cvs/dll.el
Commentary:

A doubly linked list consists of one cons cell which holds the tag
'DL-LIST in the car cell and a pointer to a dummy node in the cdr
cell. The doubly linked list is implemented as a circular list
with the dummy node first and last. The dummy node is recognized
by comparing it to the node which the cdr of the cons cell points
to.

*** pcl-cvs/elib-node.el
Commentary:

A node is implemented as an array with three elements, using
(elt node 0) as the left pointer
(elt node 1) as the right pointer
(elt node 2) as the data

points, `list-options' and `edit' options'.  The latter enters a major
mode specifically for editing option values.  Do `M-x describe-mode' in

*** prim/rect.el
Commentary:

This package provides the operations on rectangles that are ocumented

*** prim/register.el
Commentary:

This package of functions emulates and somewhat extends the venerable
TECO's `register' feature, which permits you to save various useful
pieces of buffer state to named variables.  The entry points are
documented in the XEmacs Reference Manual.
*** prim/replace.el
Commentary:

This package supplies the string and regular-expression replace functions
documented in the XEmacs Reference Manual.

All the gettext calls are for XEmacs I18N3 message catalog support.
*** prim/reposition.el
Commentary:

Reposition-window makes an entire function definition or comment visible,
or, if it is already visible, places it at the top of the window;
additional invocations toggle the visibility of comments preceding the
code.  For the gory details, see the documentation for reposition-window;
rather than reading that, you may just want to play with it.

This tries pretty hard to do the recentering correctly; the precise
action depends on what the buffer looks like.  If you find a situation
where it doesn't behave well, let me know.  This function is modeled
after one of the same name in ZMACS, but the code is all-new and the
behavior in some situations differs.

Commentary:

There's not a whole lot in common now with the FSF version,
be wary when applying differences.  I've left in a number of lines
of commentary just to give diff(1) something to synch itself with to
provide useful context diffs. -sb
*** prim/symbols.el
Commentary:

The idea behind magic variables is that you can specify arbitrary
behavior to happen when setting or retrieving a variable's value.  The
purpose of this is to make it possible to cleanly provide support for
obsolete variables (e.g. unread-command-event, which is obsolete for
unread-command-events) and variable compatibility
(e.g. suggest-key-bindings, the FSF equivalent of
teach-extended-commands-p and teach-extended-commands-timeout).
*** prim/syntax.el      Can't find any Commentary section

*** psgml/psgml-edit.el
Commentary:

Part of major mode for editing the SGML document-markup language.

*** psgml/psgml-fs.el
Commentary:

The function `style-format' formats the SGML-file in the current
buffer according to the style defined in the file `psgml-style.fs'
(or the file given by the variable `fs-style').

To try it load this file and open the test file example.sgml. Then
run the emacs command `M-x style-format'.

The style file should contain a single Lisp list. The elements of
this list, are them self lists, describe the style for an element type.
The sublists begin with the generic identifier for the element types and
the rest of the list are characteristic/value pairs.

E.g.  ("p"  block t  left 4  top 2)

Defines the style for p-elements to be blocks with left margin 4 and
at least to blank lines before the block.

*** psgml/psgml-html.el
Commentary:

*** psgml/psgml.el
Commentary:

Major mode for editing the SGML document-markup language.
*** psgml/tempo.el
Commentary:

This file provides a simple way to define powerful templates, or
macros, if you wish. It is mainly intended for, but not limited to,
other programmers to be used for creating shortcuts for editing
certain kind of documents. It was originally written to be used by
a HTML editing mode written by Nelson Minar <nelson@santafe.edu>,
and his html-helper-mode.el is probably the best example of how to
use this program.

*** term/win32-win.el
Commentary:

win32-win.el:  this file is loaded from ../lisp/startup.el when it recognizes
that win32 windows are to be used.  Command line switches are parsed and those
pertaining to win32 are processed and removed from the command line.  The
win32 display is opened and hooks are set for popping up the initial window.

startup.el will then examine startup files, and eventually call the hooks
which create the first window (s).
*** term/wyse50.el
Commentary:

The Wyse50 is ergonomically wonderful, but its escape-sequence design sucks
rocks.  The left-arrow key emits a backspace (!) and the down-arrow a line
feed (!!).  Thus, you have to unbind some commonly-used Emacs keys to
enable the arrows.

Commentary:

This package implements a full-fledged Lisp-style advice mechanism
for Emacs Lisp. Advice is a clean and efficient way to modify the
behavior of Emacs Lisp functions without having to keep  personal
modified copies of such functions around. A great number of such
modifications can be achieved by treating the original function as a
black box and specifying a different execution environment for it
with a piece of advice. Think of a piece of advice as a kind of fancy
hook that you can attach to any function/macro/subr.

This code helps GNU Emacs maintainers keep the loaddefs.el file up to

lisp source files in various useful ways.  To learn more, read the
source; if you're going to use this, you'd better be able to.

*** utils/blessmail.el
Commentary:

This is loaded into a bare Emacs to create the blessmail script,
which (on systems that need it) is used during installation
to give appropriate permissions to movemail.

It has to be done from lisp in order to be sure of getting the
correct value of rmail-spool-directory.

*** utils/browse-url.el
Commentary:

This package provides functions which read a URL (Uniform Resource
Locator) from the minibuffer, defaulting to the URL around point,
and ask a World-Wide Web browser to load it.  It can also load the
URL associated with the current buffer.  Different browsers use
different methods of remote control so there is one function for
each supported browser.  If the chosen browser is not running, it
is started.  Currently there is support for:

*** utils/derived.el
Commentary:

GNU Emacs is already, in a sense, object oriented -- each object
(buffer) belongs to a class (major mode), and that class defines
the relationship between messages (input events) and methods
(commands) by means of a keymap.

In the mean time, this package offers most of the advantages of
full inheritance with the existing major modes.  The macro
`define-derived-mode' allows the user to make a variant of an existing
major mode, with its own keymap.  The new mode will inherit the key
bindings of its parent, and will, in fact, run its parent first
every time it is called.  For example, the commands
*** utils/detached-minibuf.el
Commentary:

WARNING. DANGER.  This file reportedly crashes 19.14, use it only with a
recent XEmacs.

*** utils/docref.el
Commentary:

This package allows you to use a simple form of cross references in
your Emacs Lisp documentation strings. Cross-references look like
\\(type@[label@]data), where type defines a method for retrieving
reference informatin, data is used by a method routine as an argument,
and label "represents" the reference in text. If label is absent, data
is used instead.

Usage:

The `C-x C-k' (`edit-kbd-macro') command edits a keyboard macro
in a special buffer.  It prompts you to type a key sequence,
which should be one of:
*** utils/eldoc.el
Commentary:

This program was inspired by the behavior of the "mouse documentation
window" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
that variable's meaning.
*** utils/elp.el
Commentary:

If you want to profile a bunch of functions, set elp-function-list
to the list of symbols, then do a M-x elp-instrument-list.  This
hacks those functions so that profiling information is recorded
whenever they are called.  To print out the current results, use
M-x elp-results.  If you want output to go to standard-output
instead of a separate buffer, setq elp-use-standard-output to
non-nil.  With elp-reset-after-results set to non-nil, profiling
information will be reset whenever the results are displayed.  You
can also reset all profiling info at any time with M-x
elp-reset-all.
*** utils/facemenu.el
Commentary:

This file defines a menu of faces (bold, italic, etc) which allows you to
set the face used for a region of the buffer.  Some faces also have
keybindings, which are shown in the menu.  Faces with names beginning with
"fg:" or "bg:", as in "fg:red", are treated specially.
Such faces are assumed to consist only of a foreground (if "fg:") or
background (if "bg:") color.  They are thus put into the color submenus
rather than the general Face submenu.  These faces can also be
automatically created by selecting the "Other..." menu items in the
"Foreground" and "Background" submenus.
*** utils/find-gc.el
Commentary:

Produce in unsafe-list the set of all functions that may invoke GC.
This expects the Emacs sources to live in emacs-source-directory.
It creates a temporary working directory /tmp/esrc.
*** utils/finder.el
Commentary:

This mode uses the Keywords library header to provide code-finding
services by keyword.
*** utils/floating-toolbar.el
Commentary:

The command `floating-toolbar' pops up a small frame
containing a toolbar.  The command should be bound to a
button-press event.  If the mouse press happens over an
extent that has a non-nil 'floating-toolbar property, the
value of that property is the toolbar instantiator that will
be displayed.  Otherwise the toolbar displayed is taken from
the variable `floating-toolbar'.  This variable can be made
buffer local to produce buffer local floating toolbars.
*** utils/flow-ctrl.el
Commentary:

Terminals that use XON/XOFF flow control can cause problems with
GNU Emacs users.  This file contains Emacs Lisp code that makes it
easy for a user to deal with this problem, when using such a
terminal.

*** utils/foldout.el
Commentary:

This file provides folding editor extensions for outline-mode and
outline-minor-mode buffers.  What's a "folding editor"?  Read on...

Imagine you're in an outline-mode buffer and you've hidden all the text and
subheadings under your level-1 headings.  You now want to look at the stuff
hidden under one of these headings.  Normally you'd do C-c C-e (show-entry)
to expose the body or C-c C-i to expose the child (level-2) headings.

With foldout, you do C-c C-z (foldout-zoom-subtree).  This exposes the body
and child subheadings and narrows the buffer so that only the level-1
heading, the body and the level-2 headings are visible.  If you now want to
look under one of the level-2 headings, position the cursor on it and do C-c
C-z again.  This exposes the level-2 body and its level-3 child subheadings
and narrows the buffer again.  You can keep on zooming in on successive
subheadings as much as you like.  A string in the modeline tells you how
deep you've gone.

When shown, a record is transferred to an Emacs buffer and
presented using a user-defined form.  One record is shown at a
time.

   Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).
   If no name can be extracted, FULL-NAME will be nil.
   ADDRESS may be a string or a buffer.  If it is a buffer, the visible
    (narrowed) portion of the buffer will be interpreted as the address.
    (This feature exists so that the clever caller might be able to avoid
    consing a string.)
   If ADDRESS contains more than one RFC-822 address, only the first is
    returned.

map-y-or-n-p is a general-purpose question-asking function.
It asks a series of y/n questions (a la y-or-n-p), and decides to
applies an action to each element of a list based on the answer.
The nice thing is that you also get some other possible answers
to use, reminiscent of query-replace: ! to answer y to all remaining
questions; ESC or q to answer n to all remaining questions; . to answer
y once and then n for the remainder; and you can get help with C-h.

Commentary:

Emacs' normal undo system allows you to undo an arbitrary
number of buffer changes.  These undos are recorded as ordinary
buffer changes themselves.  So when you break the chain of
undos by issuing some other command, you can then undo all
the undos.  The chain of recorded buffer modifications
therefore grows without bound, truncated only at garbage
collection time.

Lisp Package Authors
====================
Reporter was written primarily for Emacs Lisp package authors so
that their users can easily report bugs.  When invoked,
reporter-submit-bug-report will set up an outgoing mail buffer with
the appropriate bug report address, including a lisp expression the
maintainer of the package can eval to completely reproduce the
environment in which the bug was observed (e.g. by using
eval-last-sexp).  This package proved especially useful during my
development of cc-mode, which is highly dependent on its
configuration variables.

Commentary:

A simple trace package that utilizes advice.el. It generates trace

*** utils/uniquify.el
Commentary:

Emacs's standard method for making buffer names unique adds <2>, <3>,
etc. to the end of (all but one of) the buffers.  This file replaces
that behavior, for buffers visiting files and dired buffers, with a
uniquification that adds parts of the file name until the buffer names
are unique.  For instance, buffers visiting /u/mernst/tmp/Makefile and
/usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile would be named Makefile|tmp and
Makefile|zaphod, respectively (instead of Makefile and Makefile<2>).
Other buffer name styles are also available.

* What Changed
===================


** Differences between XEmacs and GNU Emacs 19
==================================================

In XEmacs, events are first-class objects.  FSF 19 represents them as
integers, which obscures the differences between a key gesture and the
ancient ASCII code used to represent a particular overlapping subset of them.

In XEmacs, keymaps are first-class opaque objects.  FSF 19 represents them as
complicated combinations of association lists and vectors.  If you use the
advertised functional interface to manipulation of keymaps, the same code
will work in XEmacs, Emacs 18, and GNU Emacs 19; if your code depends
on the underlying implementation of keymaps, it will not.

XEmacs uses "extents" to represent all non-textual aspects of buffers;
FSF 19 uses two distinct objects, "text properties" and "overlays",
which divide up the functionality between them.  Extents are a
superset of the functionality of the two FSF data types.  The full FSF
19 interface to text properties is supported in XEmacs (with extents
being the underlying representation).

Extents can be made to be copied into strings, and thus restored by kill
and yank.  Thus, one can specify this behavior on either "extents" or
"text properties", whereas in FSF 19 text properties always have this
behavior and overlays never do.

Many more packages are provided standard with XEmacs than with FSF 19.

Pixmaps of arbitrary size can be embedded in a buffer.

Variable width fonts work.

The height of a line is the height of the tallest font on that line, instead
of all lines having the same height.

XEmacs uses the MIT "Xt" toolkit instead of raw Xlib calls, which
makes it be a more well-behaved X citizen (and also improves
portability).  A result of this is that it is possible to include
other Xt "Widgets" in the XEmacs window.  Also, XEmacs understands the
standard Xt command-line arguments.

XEmacs provides support for ToolTalk on systems that have it.

XEmacs can ask questions using popup dialog boxes.  Any command executed from
a menu will ask yes/no questions with dialog boxes, while commands executed
via the keyboard will use the minibuffer.

XEmacs has a built-in toolbar.  Four toolbars can actually be configured:
top, bottom, left, and right toolbars.

XEmacs has vertical and horizontal scrollbars.  Unlike in FSF 19 (which
provides a primitive form of vertical scrollbar), these are true toolkit
scrollbars.  A look-alike Motif scrollbar is provided for those who
don't have Motif. (Even for those who do, the look-alike may be preferable
as it is faster.)

If you're running on a machine with audio hardware, you can specify sound
files for XEmacs to play instead of the default X beep.  See the documentation
of the function load-sound-file and the variable sound-alist.

An XEmacs frame can be placed within an "external client widget" managed by
another application.  This allows an application to use an XEmacs frame as its
text pane rather than the standard Text widget that is provided with Motif or
Athena.  XEmacs supports Motif applications, generic Xt (e.g. Athena)
applications, and raw Xlib applications.

Here are some more specifics about the XEmacs implementation:

*** The Input Model
-------------------

The fundamental unit of input is an "event" instead of a character.  An
event is a new data type that contains several pieces of information.
There are several kinds of event, and corresponding accessor and utility
functions.  We tried to abstract them so that they would apply equally
well to a number of window systems.

NOTE: All timestamps are measured as milliseconds since Emacs started.

 key_press_event
    event_channel       A token representing which keyboard generated it.
                        For this kind of event, this is a frame object.
                        (This is for eventual support of multiple displays.)
    timestamp           When it happened
    key                 What keysym this is; an integer or a symbol.
                        If this is an integer, it will be in the printing
                        ASCII range: >32 and <127.
    modifiers           Bucky-bits on that key: control, meta, etc.
                        For most keys, Shift is not a bit; that is implicit
                        in the keyboard layout.

 pointer_motion_event

                        For this kind of event, this is a frame object.
    timestamp           When it happened

    modifiers           Bucky-bits down when the motion was detected.
                        (Possibly not all window systems will provide this?)

 process_event
    timestamp           When it happened
    process             the emacs "process" object in question

 timeout_event
    timestamp           Now (really, when the timeout was signaled)
    interval_id         The ID returned when the associated call to
                        add_timeout_cb() was made
        ------ the rest of the fields are filled in by Emacs -----
    id_number           The Emacs timeout ID for this timeout (more
                        than one timeout event can have the same value
                        here, since Emacs timeouts, as opposed to
                        add_timeout_cb() timeouts, can resignal
                        themselves)
    function            An elisp function to call when this timeout is
                        processed.
    object              The object passed to that function.

 eval_event
    timestamp           When it happened
    function            An elisp function to call with this event object.
    object              Anything.
                        This kind of event is used internally; sometimes the
                        window system interface would like to inform emacs of
                        some user action (such as focusing on another frame)
                        but needs that to happen synchronously with the other
                        user input, like keypresses.  This is useful when
                        events are reported through callbacks rather
                        than in the standard event stream.

 misc_user_event
    timestamp           When it happened
    function            An elisp function to call with this event object.
    object              Anything.
                        This is similar to an eval_event, except that it is
                        generated by user actions: selections in the
                        menubar or scrollbar actions.  It is a "command"
                        event, like key and mouse presses (and unlike mouse
                        motion, process output, and enter and leave window
                        hooks).  In many ways, eval_events are not the same
                        as keypresses or misc_user_events.

 magic_event
                        No user-serviceable parts within.  This is for things
                        like KeymapNotify and ExposeRegion events and so on
                        that emacs itself doesn't care about, but which it
                        must do something with for proper interaction with
                        the window system.

                        Magic_events are handled somewhat asynchronously, just
                        like subprocess filters.  However, occasionally a
                        magic_event needs to be handled synchronously; in that
                        case, the asynchronous handling of the magic_event will
                        push an eval_event back onto the queue, which will be
                        handled synchronously later.  This is one of the
                        reasons why eval_events exist; I'm not entirely happy
                        with this aspect of this event model.


The function `next-event' blocks and returns one of the above-described
event objects.  The function `dispatch-event' takes an event and processes
it in the appropriate way.

For a process-event, dispatch-event calls the process's handler; for a
mouse-motion event, the mouse-motion-handler hook is called, and so on.
For magic-events, dispatch-event does window-system-dependent things,
including calling some non-window-system-dependent hooks: map-frame-hook,
unmap-frame-hook, mouse-enter-frame-hook, and mouse-leave-frame-hook.

The function `next-command-event' calls `next-event' until it gets a key or
button from the user (that is, not a process, motion, timeout, or magic
event).  If it gets an event that is not a key or button, it calls
`dispatch-event' on it immediately and reads another one.  The
next-command-event function could be implemented in Emacs Lisp, though it
isn't.  Generally one should call `next-command-event' instead of
`next-event'.

read-char calls next-command-event; if it doesn't get an event that can be
converted to an ASCII character, it signals an error.  Otherwise it returns
an integer.

The variable `last-command-char' always contains an integer, or nil (if the
last read event has no ASCII equivalent, as when it is a mouse-click or a
non-ASCII character chord.)

The new variable `last-command-event' holds an event object, that could be
a non-ASCII character, a button click, a menu selection, etc.

The variable `unread-command-char' no longer exists, and has been replaced
by `unread-command-events'.  With the new event model, it is incorrect for
code to do (setq unread-command-char (read-char)), because all user-input
can't be represented as ASCII characters.  *** This is an incompatible
change.  Code which sets `unread-command-char' must be updated to use the
combination of `next-command-event' and `unread-command-events' instead.

The functions `this-command-keys' and `recent-keys' return a vector of
event objects, instead of a string of ASCII characters.  *** This also
is an incompatible change.

Almost nothing happens at interrupt level; the SIGIO handler simply sets a
flag, and later, the X event queue is scanned for KeyPress events which map
to ^G.  All redisplay happens in the main thread of the process.


*** Keymaps
-----------

Instead of keymaps being alists or obarrays, they are a new primary data
type.  The only user access to the contents of a keymap is through the
existing keymap-manipulation functions, and a new function, map-keymap.
This means that existing code that manipulates keymaps may need to
be changed.

One of our goals with the new input and keymap code was to make more
character combinations available for binding, besides just ASCII and
function keys.  We want to be able bind different commands to Control-a
and Control-Shift-a; we also want it to be possible for the keys Control-h
and Backspace (and Control-M and Return, and Control-I and Tab, etc) to
be distinct.

One of the most common complaints that new Emacs users have is that backspace
is help.  The answer is to play around with the keyboard-translate-table, or
be lucky enough to have a system administrator who has done this for you
already; but if it were possible to bind backspace and C-h to different
things, then (under a window manager at least) both backspace and delete
would delete a character, and ^H would be help.  There's no need to deal
with xmodmap, kbd-translate-table, etc.

Here are some more examples: suppose you want to bind one function to Tab,
and another to Control-Tab.  This can't be done if Tab and Control-I are the
same thing.  What about control keys that have no ASCII equivalent, like
Control-< ?  One might want that to be bound to set-mark-at-point-min.  We
want M-C-Backspace to be kill-backward-sexp.  But we want M-Backspace to be
kill-backward-word.  Again, this can't be done if Backspace and C-h are
indistinguishable.

The user represents keys as a string of ASCII characters (when possible and
convenient), or as a vector of event objects, or as a vector of "key
description lists", that looks like (control a), or (control meta delete)
or (shift f1).  The order of the modifier-names is not significant, so
(meta control x) and (control meta x) are the same.

`define-key' knows how to take any of the above representations and store them
into a keymap.  When Emacs wants to return a key sequence (this-command-keys,
recent-keys, keyboard-macros, and read-key-sequence, for example) it returns
a vector of event objects.  Keyboard macros can also be represented as ASCII
strings or as vectors of key description lists.

This is an incompatible change: code which calls `this-command-keys',
`recent-keys', `read-key-sequence', or manipulates keyboard-macros probably
needs to be changed so that it no longer assumes that the returned value is a
string.

Control-Shift-a is specified as (control A), not (control shift a), since A
is a two-case character.  But for keys that don't have an upper case
version, like F1, Backspace, and Escape, you use the (shift backspace) syntax.

See the doc string for our version of define-key, reproduced below in the
`Changed Functions' section.  Note that when the KEYS argument is a string,
it has the same semantics as the v18 define-key.


*** Xt Integration
------------------

The heart of the event loop is implemented in terms of the Xt event functions
(specifically XtAppProcessEvent), and uses Xt's concept of timeouts and
file-descriptor callbacks, eliminating a large amount of system-dependent code
(Xt does it for you.)

If Emacs is compiled with support for X, it uses the Xt event loop even when
Emacs is not running on an X display (the Xt event loop supports this).  This
makes it possible to run Emacs on a dumb TTY, and later connect it to one or
more X servers.  It should also be possible to later connect an existing Emacs
process to additional TTY's, although this code is still experimental.  (Our
intent at this point is not to have an Emacs that is being used by multiple
people at the same time: it is to make it possible for someone to go home, log
in on a dialup line, and connect to the same Emacs process that is running
under X in their office without having to recreate their buffer state and so
on.)

If Emacs is not compiled with support for X, then it instead uses more general
code, something like what v18 does; but this way of doing things is a lot more
modular.

(Linking Emacs with Xt seems to only add about 300k to the executable size,
compared with an Emacs linked with Xlib only.)


*** Region Highlighting
-----------------------

If the variable `zmacs-regions' is true, then the region between point and
mark will be highlighted when "active".  Those commands which push a mark
(such as C-SPC, and C-x C-x) make the region become "active" and thus
highlighted.  Most commands (all non-motion commands, basically) cause it to
become non-highlighted (non-"active").  Commands that operate on the region
(such as C-w, C-x C-l, etc.) only work if the region is in the highlighted
state.

zmacs-activate-region-hook and zmacs-deactivate-region-hook are run at the
appropriate times; under X, zmacs-activate-region-hook makes the X selection
be the region between point and mark, thus doing two things at once: making
the region and the X selection be the same; and making the region highlight
in the same way as the X selection.

If `zmacs-regions' is true, then the `mark-marker' command returns nil unless
the region is currently in the active (highlighted) state.  With an argument
of t, this returns the mark (if there is one) regardless of the active-region
state.  You should *generally* not use the mark unless the region is active,
if the user has expressed a preference for the active-region model.  Watch
out!  Moving this marker changes the mark position.  If you set the marker not
to point anywhere, the buffer will have no mark.

In this way, the primary selection is a fairly transitory entity; but
when something is copied to the kill ring, it is made the Clipboard
selection.  It is also stored into CUT_BUFFER0, for compatibility with
X applications that don't understand selections (like Emacs18).

Compatibility note: if you have code which uses (mark) or (mark-marker),
then you need to either: change those calls to (mark t) or (mark-marker t);
or simply bind `zmacs-regions' to nil around the call to mark or mark-marker.
This is probably the best solution, since it will work in Emacs 18 as well.


*** Menubars and Dialog Boxes
-----------------------------

Here is an example of a menubar definition:

(defvar default-menubar
  '(("File"     ["Open File..."         find-file               t]
                ["Save Buffer"          save-buffer             t]
                ["Save Buffer As..."    write-file              t]
                ["Revert Buffer"        revert-buffer           t]
                "-----"
                ["Print Buffer"         lpr-buffer              t]
                "-----"
                ["Delete Frame"         delete-frame            t]
                ["Kill Buffer..."       kill-buffer             t]
                ["Exit Emacs"           save-buffers-kill-emacs t]
                )
    ("Edit"     ["Undo"                 advertised-undo         t]
                ["Cut"                  kill-primary-selection  t]
                ["Copy"                 copy-primary-selection  t]
                ["Paste"                yank-clipboard-selection t]
                ["Clear"                delete-primary-selection t]
                )
    ...))

The first element of each menu item is the string to print on the menu.

The second element is the callback function; if it is a symbol, it is
invoked with `call-interactively.'  If it is a list, it is invoked with
`eval'.

If the second element is a symbol, then the menu also displays the key that
is bound to that command (if any).

The third element of the menu items determines whether the item is selectable.
It may be t, nil, or a form to evaluate.  Also, a hook is run just before a
menu is exposed, which can be used to change the value of these slots.
For example, there is a hook that makes the "undo" menu item be selectable
only in the cases when `advertised-undo' would not signal an error.

Menus may have other menus nested within them; they will cascade.

There are utility functions for adding items to menus, deleting items,
disabling them, etc.

The function `popup-menu' takes a menu description and pops it up.

The function `popup-dialog-box' takes a dialog-box description and pops
it up.  Dialog box descriptions look a lot like menu descriptions.

The menubar, menu, and dialog-box code is implemented as a library,
with an interface which hides the toolkit that implements it.


*** Isearch Changes
-------------------

Isearch has been reimplemented in a different way, adding some new features,
and causing a few incompatible changes.

 -  the old isearch-*-char variables are no longer supported.  In the old
    system, one could make ^A mean "repeat the search" by doing something
    like (setq search-repeat-char ?C-a).  In the new system, this is
    accomplished with

       (define-key isearch-mode-map "\C-a" 'isearch-repeat-forward)

 -  The advantage of using the normal keymap mechanism for this is that you
    can bind more than one key to an isearch command: for example, both C-a
    and C-s could do the same thing inside isearch mode.  You can also bind
    multi-key sequences inside of isearch mode, and bind non-ASCII keys.
    For example, to use the F1 key to terminate a search:

       (define-key isearch-mode-map 'f1 'isearch-exit)

    or to make ``C-c C-c'' terminate a search:

       (define-key isearch-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 'isearch-exit)

 -  If isearch is behaving case-insensitively (the default) and you type an
    upper case character, then the search will become case-sensitive.  This
    can be disabled by setting `search-caps-disable-folding' to nil.

 -  There is a history ring of the strings previously searched for; typing
    M-p or M-n while searching will cycle through this ring.  Typing M-TAB
    will do completion across the set of items in the history ring.

 -  The ESC key is no longer used to terminate an incremental search.  The
    RET key should be used instead.  This change is necessary for it to be
    possible to bind "meta" characters to isearch commands.


*** Startup Code Changes
------------------------

The initial X frame is mapped before the user's .emacs file is executed.
Without this, there is no way for the user to see any error messages
generated by their .emacs file, any windows created by the .emacs file
don't show up, and the copyleft notice isn't shown.

The default values for load-path, exec-path, lock-directory, and
Info-directory-list are not (necessarily) built into Emacs, but are
computed at startup time.

First, Emacs looks at the directory in which its executable file resides:

  o  If that directory contains subdirectories named "lisp" and "lib-src",
     then those directories are used as the lisp library and exec directory.

  o  If the parent of the directory in which the emacs executable is located
     contains "lisp" and "lib-src" subdirectories, then those are used.

  o  If ../lib/xemacs-<version> (starting from the directory in which the
     emacs executable is located) contains a "lisp" subdirectory and either
     a "lib-src" subdirectory or a <configuration-name> subdirectory, then
     those are used.

  o  If the emacs executable that was run is a symbolic link, then the link
     is chased, and the resultant directory is checked as above.

(Actually, it doesn't just look for "lisp/", it looks for "lisp/prim/",
which reduces the chances of a false positive.)

If the lisp directory contains subdirectories, they are added to the default
load-path as well.  If the site-lisp directory exists and contains
subdirectories, they are then added.  Subdirectories whose names begin with
a dot or a hyphen are not added to the load-path.

These heuristics fail if the Emacs binary was copied from the main Emacs
tree to some other directory, and links for the lisp directory were not put
in.  This isn't much of a restriction: either make there be subdirectories
(or symbolic links) of the directory of the emacs executable, or make the
"installed" emacs executable be a symbolic link to an executable in a more
appropriate directory structure.  For example, this setup works:

    /usr/local/xemacs/xemacs*           ; The executable.
    /usr/local/xemacs/lisp/             ; The associated directories.
    /usr/local/xemacs/etc/              ; Any of the files in this list
    /usr/local/xemacs/lock/             ; could be symbolic links as well.
    /usr/local/xemacs/info/

As does this:

    /usr/local/bin/xemacs -> ../xemacs/src/xemacs-19.14 ; A link...
    /usr/local/xemacs/src/xemacs-19.14*                 ; The executable,
    /usr/local/xemacs/lisp/                             ; and the rest of
    /usr/local/xemacs/etc/                              ; the source tree
    /usr/local/xemacs/lock/
    /usr/local/xemacs/info/

This configuration might be used for a multi-architecture installation; assume
that $LOCAL refers to a directory which contains only files specific to a
particular architecture (i.e., executables) and $SHARED refers to those files
which are not machine specific (i.e., lisp code and documentation.)

    $LOCAL/bin/xemacs@ -> $LOCAL/xemacs-19.14/xemacs*
    $LOCAL/xemacs-19.14/lisp@ -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/lisp/
    $LOCAL/xemacs-19.14/etc@  -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/etc/
    $LOCAL/xemacs-19.14/info@ -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/info/

The following would also work, but the above is probably more attractive:

    $LOCAL/bin/xemacs*
    $LOCAL/bin/lisp@ -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/lisp/
    $LOCAL/bin/etc@  -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/etc/
    $LOCAL/bin/info@ -> $SHARED/xemacs-19.14/info/

If Emacs can't find the requisite directories, it writes a message like this
(or some appropriate subset of it) to stderr:

  WARNING:
  couldn't find an obvious default for load-path, exec-directory, and
  lock-directory, and there were no defaults specified in paths.h when
  Emacs was built.  Perhaps some directories don't exist, or the Emacs
  executable, /cadillac-th/jwz/somewhere/xemacs is in a strange place?

  Without both exec-directory and load-path, Emacs will be very broken.
  Consider making a symbolic link from /cadillac-th/jwz/somewhere/etc
  to wherever the appropriate Emacs etc/ directory is, and from
  /cadillac-th/jwz/somewhere/lisp/ to wherever the appropriate Emacs
  lisp library is.

  Without lock-directory set, file locking won't work.  Consider
  creating /cadillac-th/jwz/somewhere/lock as a directory or symbolic
  link for use as the lock directory.

The default installation tree is the following:

    /usr/local/bin/b2m                          ;
                   ctags                        ; executables that
                   emacsclient                  ; should be in
                   etags                        ; user's path
                   xemacs -> xemacs-<version>   ;
                   xemacs                       ;
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs/lock
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs-<version>/etc         ; architecture ind. files
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs-<version>/info
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs-<version>/lisp
    /usr/local/lib/xemacs-<version>/<configuration>  ; binaries emacs may run


*** X Resources
---------------

(Note: This section is copied verbatim from the XEmacs Reference Manual.)

   The Emacs resources are generally set per-frame. Each Emacs frame
can have its own name or the same name as another, depending on the
name passed to the `make-frame' function.

   You can specify resources for all frames with the syntax:

     Emacs*parameter: value

or

     Emacs*EmacsFrame.parameter:value

You can specify resources for a particular frame with the syntax:

     Emacs*FRAME-NAME.parameter: value


**** Geometry Resources
-----------------------

   To make the default size of all Emacs frames be 80 columns by 55
lines, do this:

     Emacs*EmacsFrame.geometry: 80x55

To set the geometry of a particular frame named `fred', do this:

     Emacs*fred.geometry: 80x55

Important! Do not use the following syntax:

     Emacs*geometry: 80x55

You should never use `*geometry' with any X application. It does not
say "make the geometry of Emacs be 80 columns by 55 lines."  It really
says, "make Emacs and all subwindows thereof be 80x55 in whatever units
they care to measure in."  In particular, that is both telling the
Emacs text pane to be 80x55 in characters, and telling the menubar pane
to be 80x55 pixels, which is surely not what you want.

   As a special case, this geometry specification also works (and sets
the default size of all Emacs frames to 80 columns by 55 lines):

     Emacs.geometry: 80x55

since that is the syntax used with most other applications (since most
other applications have only one top-level window, unlike Emacs).  In
general, however, the top-level shell (the unmapped ApplicationShell
widget named `Emacs' that is the parent of the shell widgets that
actually manage the individual frames) does not have any interesting
resources on it, and you should set the resources on the frames instead.

   The `-geometry' command-line argument sets only the geometry of the
initial frame created by Emacs.

   A more complete explanation of geometry-handling is

   * The `-geometry' command-line option sets the `Emacs.geometry'
     resource, that is, the geometry of the ApplicationShell.

   * For the first frame created, the size of the frame is taken from
     the ApplicationShell if it is specified, otherwise from the
     geometry of the frame.

   * For subsequent frames, the order is reversed: First the frame, and
     then the ApplicationShell.

   * For the first frame created, the position of the frame is taken
     from the ApplicationShell (`Emacs.geometry') if it is specified,
     otherwise from the geometry of the frame.

   * For subsequent frames, the position is taken only from the frame,
     and never from the ApplicationShell.

   This is rather complicated, but it does seem to provide the most
intuitive behavior with respect to the default sizes and positions of
frames created in various ways.


**** Iconic Resources
---------------------

   Analogous to `-geometry', the `-iconic' command-line option sets the
iconic flag of the ApplicationShell (`Emacs.iconic') and always applies
to the first frame created regardless of its name.  However, it is
possible to set the iconic flag on particular frames (by name) by using
the `Emacs*FRAME-NAME.iconic' resource.


**** Resource List
------------------

   Emacs frames accept the following resources:

`geometry' (class `Geometry'): string
     Initial geometry for the frame.  *Note Geometry Resources:: for a
     complete discussion of how this works.

`iconic' (class `Iconic'): boolean
     Whether this frame should appear in the iconified state.

`internalBorderWidth' (class `InternalBorderWidth'): int
     How many blank pixels to leave between the text and the edge of the
     window.

`interline' (class `Interline'): int
     How many pixels to leave between each line (may not be
     implemented).

`menubar' (class `Menubar'): boolean
     Whether newly-created frames should initially have a menubar.  Set
     to true by default.

`initiallyUnmapped' (class `InitiallyUnmapped'): boolean
     Whether XEmacs should leave the initial frame unmapped when it
     starts up.  This is useful if you are starting XEmacs as a server
     (e.g. in conjunction with gnuserv or the external client widget).
     You can also control this with the `-unmapped' command-line option.

`barCursor' (class `BarColor'): boolean
     Whether the cursor should be displayed as a bar, or the
     traditional box.

`textPointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to use when the mouse is over text.  This resource is
     used to initialize the variable `x-pointer-shape'.

`selectionPointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to use when the mouse is over a selectable text region
     (an extent with the `highlight' property; for example, an Info
     cross-reference).  This resource is used to initialize the variable
     `x-selection-pointer-shape'.

`spacePointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to use when the mouse is over a blank space in a buffer
     (that is, after the end of a line or after the end-of-file).  This
     resource is used to initialize the variable
     `x-nontext-pointer-shape'.

`modeLinePointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to use when the mouse is over a mode line.  This
     resource is used to initialize the variable `x-mode-pointer-shape'.

`gcPointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to display when a garbage-collection is in progress.
     This resource is used to initialize the variable
     `x-gc-pointer-shape'.

`scrollbarPointer' (class `Cursor'): cursor-name
     The cursor to use when the mouse is over the scrollbar.  This
     resource is used to initialize the variable
     `x-scrollbar-pointer-shape'.

`pointerColor' (class `Foreground'): color-name
`pointerBackground' (class `Background'): color-name
     The foreground and background colors of the mouse cursor.  These
     resources are used to initialize the variables
     `x-pointer-foreground-color' and `x-pointer-background-color'.

`scrollBarWidth' (class `ScrollBarWidth'): integer
     How wide the vertical scrollbars should be, in pixels; 0 means no
     vertical scrollbars.  You can also use a resource specification of
     the form `*scrollbar.width', or the usual toolkit scrollbar
     resources: `*XmScrollBar.width' (Motif), `*XlwScrollBar.width'
     (Lucid), or `*Scrollbar.thickness' (Athena).  We don't recommend
     that you use the toolkit resources, though, because they're
     dependent on how exactly your particular build of XEmacs was
     configured.

`scrollBarHeight' (class `ScrollBarHeight'): integer
     How high the horizontal scrollbars should be, in pixels; 0 means no
     horizontal scrollbars.  You can also use a resource specification
     of the form `*scrollbar.height', or the usual toolkit scrollbar
     resources: `*XmScrollBar.height' (Motif), `*XlwScrollBar.height'
     (Lucid), or `*Scrollbar.thickness' (Athena).  We don't recommend
     that you use the toolkit resources, though, because they're
     dependent on how exactly your particular build of XEmacs was
     configured.

`scrollBarPlacement' (class `ScrollBarPlacement'): string
     Where the horizontal and vertical scrollbars should be positioned.
     This should be one of the four strings `bottom-left',
     `bottom-right', `top-left', and `top-right'.  Default is
     `bottom-right' for the Motif and Lucid scrollbars and
     `bottom-left' for the Athena scrollbars.

`topToolBarHeight' (class `TopToolBarHeight'): integer
`bottomToolBarHeight' (class `BottomToolBarHeight'): integer
`leftToolBarWidth' (class `LeftToolBarWidth'): integer
`rightToolBarWidth' (class `RightToolBarWidth'): integer
     Height and width of the four possible toolbars.

`topToolBarShadowColor' (class `TopToolBarShadowColor'): color-name
`bottomToolBarShadowColor' (class `BottomToolBarShadowColor'): color-name
     Color of the top and bottom shadows for the toolbars.  NOTE: These
     resources do *not* have anything to do with the top and bottom
     toolbars (i.e. the toolbars at the top and bottom of the frame)!
     Rather, they affect the top and bottom shadows around the edges of
     all four kinds of toolbars.

`topToolBarShadowPixmap' (class `TopToolBarShadowPixmap'): pixmap-name
`bottomToolBarShadowPixmap' (class `BottomToolBarShadowPixmap'): pixmap-name
     Pixmap of the top and bottom shadows for the toolbars.  If set,
     these resources override the corresponding color resources. NOTE:
     These resources do *not* have anything to do with the top and
     bottom toolbars (i.e. the toolbars at the top and bottom of the
     frame)!  Rather, they affect the top and bottom shadows around the
     edges of all four kinds of toolbars.

`toolBarShadowThickness' (class `ToolBarShadowThickness'): integer
     Thickness of the shadows around the toolbars, in pixels.

`visualBell' (class `VisualBell'): boolean
     Whether XEmacs should flash the screen rather than making an
     audible beep.

`bellVolume' (class `BellVolume'): integer
     Volume of the audible beep.

`useBackingStore' (class `UseBackingStore'): boolean
     Whether XEmacs should set the backing-store attribute of the X
     windows it creates.  This increases the memory usage of the X
     server but decreases the amount of X traffic necessary to update
     the screen, and is useful when the connection to the X server goes
     over a low-bandwidth line such as a modem connection.


**** Face Resources
-------------------

   The attributes of faces are also per-frame. They can be specified as:

     Emacs.FACE_NAME.parameter: value

     (*do not* use `Emacs*FACE_NAME...')

or

     Emacs*FRAME_NAME.FACE_NAME.parameter: value

Faces accept the following resources:

`attributeFont' (class `AttributeFont'): font-name
     The font of this face.

`attributeForeground' (class `AttributeForeground'): color-name
`attributeBackground' (class `AttributeBackground'): color-name
     The foreground and background colors of this face.

`attributeBackgroundPixmap' (class `AttributeBackgroundPixmap'): file-name
     The name of an XBM file (or XPM file, if your version of Emacs
     supports XPM), to use as a background stipple.

`attributeUnderline' (class `AttributeUnderline'): boolean
     Whether text in this face should be underlined.

   All text is displayed in some face, defaulting to the face named
`default'.  To set the font of normal text, use
`Emacs*default.attributeFont'. To set it in the frame named `fred', use
`Emacs*fred.default.attributeFont'.

   These are the names of the predefined faces:

`default'
     Everything inherits from this.

`bold'
     If this is not specified in the resource database, Emacs tries to
     find a bold version of the font of the default face.

`italic'
     If this is not specified in the resource database, Emacs tries to
     find an italic version of the font of the default face.

`bold-italic'
     If this is not specified in the resource database, Emacs tries to
     find a bold-italic version of the font of the default face.

`modeline'
     This is the face that the modeline is displayed in.  If not
     specified in the resource database, it is determined from the
     default face by reversing the foreground and background colors.

`highlight'
     This is the face that highlighted extents (for example, Info
     cross-references and possible completions, when the mouse passes
     over them) are displayed in.

`left-margin'
`right-margin'
     These are the faces that the left and right annotation margins are
     displayed in.

`zmacs-region'
     This is the face that mouse selections are displayed in.

`text-cursor'
     This is the face that the cursor is displayed in.

`isearch'
     This is the face that the matched text being searched for is
     displayed in.

`info-node'
     This is the face of info menu items.  If unspecified, it is copied
     from `bold-italic'.

`info-xref'
     This is the face of info cross-references.  If unspecified, it is
     copied from `bold'. (Note that, when the mouse passes over a
     cross-reference, the cross-reference's face is determined from a
     combination of the `info-xref' and `highlight' faces.)

   Other packages might define their own faces; to see a list of all
faces, use any of the interactive face-manipulation commands such as
`set-face-font' and type `?' when you are prompted for the name of a
face.

   If the `bold', `italic', and `bold-italic' faces are not specified
in the resource database, then XEmacs attempts to derive them from the
font of the default face.  It can only succeed at this if you have
specified the default font using the XLFD (X Logical Font Description)
format, which looks like

     *-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*

If you use any of the other, less strict font name formats, some of
which look like

     lucidasanstypewriter-12
     fixed
     9x13

   then XEmacs won't be able to guess the names of the bold and italic
versions.  All X fonts can be referred to via XLFD-style names, so you
should use those forms.  See the man pages for `X(1)', `xlsfonts(1)',
and `xfontsel(1)'.


**** Widgets
------------

   There are several structural widgets between the terminal EmacsFrame
widget and the top level ApplicationShell; the exact names and types of
these widgets change from release to release (for example, they changed
in 19.9, 19.10, 19.12, and 19.13) and are subject to further change in
the future, so you should avoid mentioning them in your resource database.
The above-mentioned syntaxes should be forward-compatible.  As of 19.14,
the exact widget hierarchy is as follows:

    INVOCATION-NAME           "shell"              "container"     FRAME-NAME
    x-emacs-application-class "TopLevelEmacsShell" "EmacsManager" "EmacsFrame"

(for normal frames)

or

    INVOCATION-NAME           "shell"               "container"     FRAME-NAME
    x-emacs-application-class "TransientEmacsShell" "EmacsManager" "EmacsFrame"

(for popup/dialog-box frames)

where INVOCATION-NAME is the terminal component of the name of the
XEmacs executable (usually `xemacs'), and `x-emacs-application-class'
is generally `Emacs'.


**** Menubar Resources
----------------------

   As the menubar is implemented as a widget which is not a part of
XEmacs proper, it does not use the face mechanism for specifying fonts
and colors: It uses whatever resources are appropriate to the type of
widget which is used to implement it.

   If Emacs was compiled to use only the Motif-lookalike menu widgets,
then one way to specify the font of the menubar would be

     Emacs*menubar*font: *-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*

   If the Motif library is being used, then one would have to use

     Emacs*menubar*fontList: *-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*

   because the Motif library uses the `fontList' resource name instead
of `font', which has subtly different semantics.

   The same is true of the scrollbars: They accept whichever resources
are appropriate for the toolkit in use.


*** Source Code Highlighting
----------------------------

It's possible to have your buffers "decorated" with fonts or colors
indicating syntactic structures (such as strings, comments, function names,
"reserved words", etc.).  In XEmacs, the preferred way to do this is with
font-lock-mode; activate it by adding the following code to your .emacs file:

        (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
        (add-hook 'c-mode-hook          'turn-on-font-lock)
        (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook        'turn-on-font-lock)
        (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook      'turn-on-font-lock)
        ...etc...

To customize it, see the descriptions of the function `font-lock-mode' and
the variables `font-lock-keywords', `c-font-lock-keywords', etc.

There exist several other source code highlighting packages, but font-lock
does one thing that most others don't do: highlights as you type new text;
and one thing that no others do: bases part of its decoration on the
syntax table of the major mode.  Font-lock has C-level support to do this
efficiently, so it should also be significantly faster than the others.

If there's something that another highlighting package does that you can't
make font-lock do, let us know.  We would prefer to consolidate all of the
desired functionality into one package rather than ship several different
packages which do essentially the same thing in different ways.


** Differences Between XEmacs and Emacs 18
==========================================

Auto-configure support has been added, so it should be fairly easy to compile
XEmacs on different systems.  If you have any problems or feedback about
compiling on your system, please let us know.

We have reimplemented the basic input model in a more general way; instead of
X input being a special-case of the normal ASCII input stream, XEmacs has a
concept of "input events", and ASCII characters are a subset of that.  The
events that XEmacs knows about are not X events, but are a generalization of
them, so that XEmacs can eventually be ported to different window systems.

We have reimplemented keymaps so that sequences of events can be stored into
them instead of just ASCII codes; it is possible to, for example, bind
different commands to each of the chords Control-h, Control-H, Backspace,
Control-Backspace, and Super-Shift-Backspace.  Key bindings, function key
bindings, and mouse bindings live in the same keymaps.

Input and display of all ISO-8859-1 characters is supported.

You can have multiple X windows ("frames" in XEmacs terminology).

XEmacs has objects called "extents" and "faces", which are roughly
analogous to Epoch's "buttons," "zones," and "styles."  An extent is a
region of text (a start position and an end position) and a face is a
collection of textual attributes like fonts and colors.  Every extent
is displayed in some "face", so changing the properties of a face
immediately updates the display of all associated extents.  Faces can
be frame-local: you can have a region of text which displays with
completely different attributes when its buffer is viewed from a
different X window.

The display attributes of faces may be specified either in lisp or through
the X resource manager.

Pixmaps of arbitrary size can be embedded in a buffer.

Variable width fonts work.

The height of a line is the height of the tallest font on that line, instead
of all lines having the same height.

XEmacs uses the MIT "Xt" toolkit instead of raw Xlib calls, which
makes it be a more well-behaved X citizen (and also improves
portability).  A result of this is that it is possible to include
other Xt "Widgets" in the XEmacs window.  Also, XEmacs understands the
standard Xt command-line arguments.

XEmacs understands the X11 "Selection" mechanism; it's possible to define
and customize selection converter functions and new selection types from
Emacs Lisp, without having to recompile XEmacs.

XEmacs provides support for ToolTalk on systems that have it.

XEmacs supports the Zmacs/Lispm style of region highlighting, where the
region between the point and mark is highlighted when in its "active" state.

XEmacs has a menubar, whose contents are customizable from emacs-lisp.
This menubar looks Motif-ish, but does not require Motif.  If you already
own Motif, however, you can configure XEmacs to use a *real* Motif menubar
instead.

XEmacs can ask questions using popup dialog boxes.  Any command executed from
a menu will ask yes/no questions with dialog boxes, while commands executed
via the keyboard will use the minibuffer.

XEmacs has vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

The initial load-path is computed at run-time, instead of at compile-time.
This means that if you move the XEmacs executable and associated directories
to somewhere else, you don't have to recompile anything.

You can specify what the title of the XEmacs windows and icons should be
with the variables `frame-title-format' and `frame-icon-title-format',
which have the same syntax as `mode-line-format'.

XEmacs now supports floating-point numbers.

XEmacs now knows about timers directly, instead of them being simulated by
a subprocess.

XEmacs understands truenames, and can be configured to notice when you are
visiting two names of the same file.  See the variables find-file-use-truenames
and find-file-compare-truenames.

If you're running on a machine with audio hardware, you can specify sound
files for XEmacs to play instead of the default X beep.  See the documentation
of the function load-sound-file and the variable sound-alist.

An XEmacs frame can be placed within an "external client widget" managed by
another application.  This allows an application to use an XEmacs frame as its
text pane rather than the standard Text widget that is provided with Motif or
Athena.  XEmacs supports Motif applications, generic Xt (e.g. Athena)
applications, and raw Xlib applications.

Random changes to the emacs-lisp library: (some of this was not written by
us, but is included because it's free software and we think it's good stuff)

  - there is a new optimizing byte-compiler
  - there is a new abbrev-based mail-alias mechanism
  - the -*- line can contain local-variable settings
  - there is a new TAGS package
  - there is a new VI-emulation mode (viper)
  - there is a new implementation of Dired
  - there is a new implementation of Isearch
  - the VM package for reading mail is provided
  - the W3 package for browsing the World Wide Web hypertext information
    system is provided
  - the Hyperbole package, a programmable information management and
    hypertext system
  - the OO-Browser package, a multi-language object-oriented browser

There are many more specifics in the "Miscellaneous Changes" section, below.

The online Emacs Manual and Emacs-Lisp Manual are now both relatively
up-to-date.

** Major Differences Between 19.13 and 19.14
============================================

XEmacs has a new address!  The canonical ftp site is now
ftp.xemacs.org:/pub/xemacs and the Web page is now at
http://www.xemacs.org/.  All mailing lists now have @xemacs.org
addresses.  For the time being the @cs.uiuc.edu addresses will
continue to function.

This is a major new release.  Many features have been added, as well
as many bugs fixed.  The Motif menubar has still _NOT_ been fixed for
19.14.  You should use the Lucid menubar instead.



Major user-visible changes:
---------------------------

-- Color support in TTY mode is provided.  You have to have a TTY capable
   of displaying them, such as color xterm or the console under Linux.
   If your terminal type supports colors (e.g. `xterm-color'), XEmacs
   will automatically notice this and start using color.

-- blink-cursor-mode enables a blinking text cursor.  There is a
   menubar option for this also.

-- auto-show-mode is turned on by default; this means that XEmacs
   will automatically scroll a window horizontally as necessary to
   keep point in view.

-- a file dialog box is provided and will be used whenever you
   are prompted for a filename as a result of a menubar selection.

-- XEmacs can be compiled with built-in GIF, JPEG, and PNG support.
   The GIF libraries are supplied with XEmacs; for JPEG and PNG,
   you have to obtain the appropriate libraries (this is well-
   documented).  This makes image display much easier and faster under
   W3 (the web browser) and TM (adds MIME support to VM and GNUS;
   not yet included with XEmacs but will be in 19.15).

-- XEmacs provides a really nice mode (PSGML with "Wing improvements")
   for editing HTML and other SGML documents.  It parses the document,
   and as a result it does proper indentation, can show you the context
   you're in, the allowed tags at a particular position, etc.

-- XEmacs comes standard with modes for editing Java and VRML code,
   including font-lock support.

-- GNUS 5.2 comes standard with XEmacs.

-- You can now embed colors in the modeline, with different sections
   of the modeline responding appropriately to various mouse gestures:
   For example, clicking on the "read-only" indicator toggles the
   read-only status of a buffer, and clicking on the buffer name
   cycles to the next buffer.  Pressing button3 on these areas brings
   up a popup menu of appropriate commands.

-- There is a much nicer mode for completion lists and such.
   At the minibuffer prompt, if you hit page-up or Meta-V, the completion
   buffer will be displayed (if it wasn't already), you're moved into
   it, and can move around and select filenames using the arrow keys
   and the return key.  Rather than a cursor, a filename is highlighted,
   and the arrow keys change which filename is highlighted.

-- The edit-faces subsystem has also been much improved, in somewhat
   similar ways to the completion list improvements.

-- Many improvements were made to the multi-device support.
   We now provide an auxiliary utility called "gnuattach" that
   lets you connect to an existing XEmacs process and display
   a TTY frame on the current TTY connection, and commands
   `make-frame-on-display' (with a corresponding menubar entry)
   and `make-frame-on-tty' for more easily creating frames on
   new TTY or X connections.

-- We have incorporated nearly all of the functionality of GNU Emacs
   19.30 into XEmacs.  This includes support for lazy-loaded
   byte code and documentation strings, improved paragraph filling,
   better support for margins within documents, v19 regular expression
   routines (including caching of compiled regexps), etc.

-- In accordance with GNU Emacs 19.30, the following key binding
   changes have been made:

   C-x ESC -> C-x ESC ESC
   ESC ESC -> ESC :
   ESC ESC ESC is "abort anything" (keyboard-escape-quit).

-- All major packages have been updated to their latest-released
   versions.

-- XEmacs now gracefully handles a full colormap (such as typically
   results when running Netscape).  The nearest available color
   is automatically substituted.

-- Many bug fixes to the subprocess/PTY code, ps-print, menubar
   functions, `set-text-properties', DEC Alpha support, toolbar
   resizing (the "phantom VM toolbar" bug), and lots and lots
   of other things were made.

-- The ncurses library (a replacement for curses, found especially
   under Linux) is supported, and will be automatically used
   if it can be found.

-- You can now undo in the minibuffer.

-- Surrogate minibuffers now work.  These are also sometimes referred
   to as "global" minibuffers.

-- font-lock has been merged with GNU Emacs 19.30, improved defaults
   have been added, and changes have been made to the way it is
   configured.

-- Many, many modes have menubar entries for them.

-- `recover-session' lets you recover whatever files can be recovered
   after your XEmacs process has died unexpectedly.

-- C-h k followed by a toolbar button press correctly reports
   the binding of the toolbar button.

-- `function-key-map', `key-translation-map', and `keyboard-translate-table'
   are now correctly implemented.

-- `show-message-log' (and its menubar entry under Edit) have been
   removed; instead use `view-lossage' (and its menubar entry under
   Help).

-- There is a standard menubar entry for specifying which browser
   (Netscape, W3, Mosaic, etc.) to use when dispatching URL's
   in mail, Usenet news, etc.

-- Improved native sound support under Linux.

-- Lots of other things we forgot to mention.



Significant Lisp-level changes:
-------------------------------

-- Many improvements to the E-Lisp documentation have been made;
   it should now be up-to-date and complete in nearly all cases.

-- XEmacs has extensive documentation on its internals, for
   would-be C hackers.

-- Common-Lisp support (the CL package) is now dumped standard
   into XEmacs.  No more need for (require 'cl) or anything
   like that.

-- Full support for extents and text properties over strings is
   provided.

-- The extent properties `start-open', `end-open', `start-closed',
   and `end-closed' now work correctly w.r.t. text properties.

-- The `face' property of extents and text properties can now
   be a list.

-- The `mouse-face' property from GNU Emacs is now supported.
   It supersedes the `highlight' property.

-- `enriched' and `facemenu' packages from GNU Emacs have been ported.

-- New functions for easier creation of dialog boxes:
   `get-dialog-box-response', `message-box', and `message-or-box'.

-- `function-min-args' and `function-max-args' allow you to determine
   the minimum and maximum allowed arguments for any type of
   function (i.e. subr, lambda expression, byte-compiled function, etc.).

-- Some C-level support for doing E-Lisp profiling is provided.
   See `start-profiling', `stop-profiling', and
   `pretty-print-profiling-info'.

-- `current-process-time' reports the user, system, and real times
   for the currently running XEmacs process.

-- `next-window', `previous-window', `next-frame', `previous-frame',
   `other-window', `get-lru-window', etc. have an extra device
   argument that allows you to restrict which devices it includes
   (normally all devices).  Some functions that incorrectly ignored
   frames on different devices (e.g. C-x 0) are fixed.

-- new functions `run-hook-with-args-until-success',
   `run-hook-with-args-until-failure'.

-- generalized facility for local vs. global hooks.  See `make-local-hook',
   `add-hook'.

-- New functions for querying the window tree: `frame-leftmost-window',
   `frame-rightmost-window', `window-first-hchild', `window-first-vchild',
   `window-next-child', `window-previous-child', and `window-parent'.

-- Epoch support works.  This gets you direct access to some X events
   and objects (e.g. properties and property-notify events).

-- The multi-device support has been majorly revamped.  There is now
   a new concept of "consoles" (devices grouped together under a
   common keyboard/mouse), console-local variables, and a generalized
   concept of device/console connection.

-- `display-buffer' synched with GNU Emacs 19.30, giving you lots of
   wondrous cruft such as
     -- unsplittable frames
     -- pop-up-frames, pop-up-frame-function
     -- special-display-buffer-names, special-display-regexps,
        special-display-function
     -- same-window-buffer-names, same-window-regexps

-- XEmacs has support for accessing DBM- and/or DB-format databases,
   provided that you have the appropriate libraries on your system.

-- There is a new font style: "strikethru" fonts.

-- New data type "weak list", which is a list with special
   garbage-collection properties, similar to weak hash tables.

-- `set-face-parent' makes one face inherit all properties from another.

-- The junky frame parameters mechanism has been revamped as
   frame properties, which a standard property-list interface.

-- Lots and lots of functions for working with property lists have
   been added.

-- New functions `push-window-configuration', `pop-window-configuration',
   `unpop-window-configuration' for maintain a stack of window
   configurations.

-- Many fixups to the glyph code; icons and mouse pointers are now
   properly merged into the glyph mechanism.

-- `set-specifier' works more sensibly, like `set-face-property'.

-- Many new specifiers for individually controlling toolbar height/width
   and visibility and text cursor visibility.

-- New face `text-cursor' controls the colors of the text cursor.

-- Many new variables for turning on debug information about the
   inner workings of XEmacs.

-- Hash tables can now compare their keys using `equal' or `eql'
   as well as `eq'.

-- Other things too numerous to mention.



Significant configuration/build changes:
----------------------------------------

-- You can disable TTY support, toolbar support, scrollbar support,
   menubar support, and/or dialog box support at configure time
   to save memory.

-- New configure option `--extra-verbose' shows the diagnostic
   output from feature testing; this should help track down
   problems with incorrect feature detection.

-- `dont-have-xmu' is now `with-xmu', with the reversed sense.
   (It defaults to `yes'.)

-- `with-mocklisp' lets you add Mocklisp support if you really
   need this.

-- `with-term' for adding TERM support for Linux users.



** Major Differences Between 19.12 and 19.13
============================================

This is primarily a bug-fix release.  Lots of bugs have been fixed.
Hopefully only a few have been introduced.  The most noteworthy bug
fixes are:

 -- There should be no more problems connecting XEmacs to an X
    server over SLIP or other slow connections.
 -- Periodic crashes when using the Buffers menu should be gone.
 -- etags would sometimes erase the current buffer; it doesn't
    any more.
 -- XEmacs will correctly exit if the X server dies.
 -- uniconified frames are displayed properly under TVTWM.
 -- Breakage in `add-menu-item' / `add-menu-button' is fixed.

The Motif menubar has _NOT_ been fixed for 19.13.  You should use the
Lucid menubar instead.

Multi-device support should now be working properly.  You can now open
an X device after having started out on a TTY device.

Background pixmaps now work.  See `set-face-background-pixmap'.

Echo area messages are now saved to a buffer, " *Message Log*".  To
see this buffer, use the command `show-message-log'.  It is possible
to filter the message which are actually included by modifying the
variables `log-message-ignore-regexps' and `log-message-ignore-labels'.

You can now control which warnings you want to see.  See
`display-warning-suppressed-classes' and friends.

You can now set the default location of an "other window" from the
Options menu.

"Save Options" now saves the state of all faces.

You can choose which file "Save Options" writes into; see
`save-options-file'.

XPM support is no longer required for the toolbar.

The relocating allocator is now enabled by default whenever possible.
This allows buffer memory to be returned to the system when no longer
in use which helps keep XEmacs process size down.

The ability to have captioned toolbars has been added.  Currently only
the default toolbar actually has a captioned version provided.  A new
specifier variable, `toolbar-buttons-captioned-p' controls whether the
toolbar is captioned.

A copy of the XEmacs FAQ is now included and is available through info.

The on-line E-Lisp reference manual has been significantly updated.

There is now audio support under Linux.

Modifier keys can now be sticky.  This is controlled by the variable
`modifier-keys-are-sticky'.

manual-entry should now work correctly under Irix with the penalty of
a longer startup time the first time it is invoked.  If you are having
problems with this on another system try setting
`Manual-use-subdirectory-list' to t.

make-tty-device no longer automatically creates the first frame.

Rectangular regions now work correctly.

ediff no longer sets synchronize-minibuffers to t unless you first set
ediff-synchronize-minibuffers

keyboard-translate-table has been implemented.  This means that the
`enable-flow-control' command for dealing with TTY connections that
filter out ^S and ^Q now works.

You can now create frames that are initially unmapped and frames that
are "transient for another frame", meaning that they behave more like
dialog-box frames.

Other E-Lisp changes:

-- Specifier `menubar-visible-p' for controlling menubar visibility
-- Local command hooks should be set using `local-pre-command-hook'
   and `local-post-command-hook' instead of making the global
   equivalents be buffer-local.
-- `quit-char', `help-char', `meta-prefix-char' can be any key specifier
   instead of just an integer.
-- new functions `add-async-timeout' and `disable-async-timeout'.
   These let you create asynchronous timeouts, which are like
   normal timeouts except that they're executed even during
   running Lisp code.  Use this with care!
-- `debug-on-error' and `stack-trace-on-error' now enter the debugger
   only when an *unhandled* error occurs.  If you want the old
   behavior, use `debug-on-signal' and `stack-trace-on-signal'.
-- \U, \L, \u, \l, \E recognized specially in `replace-match'.
   These are standard ex/perl commands for changing the case of
   replaced text.
-- New function event-matches-key-specifier-p.  This provides
   a clean way of comparing keypress events with key specifiers
   such as 65, (shift home), etc. without having to resort
   to ugly `character-to-event' / `event-to-character' hacks.
-- New function `add-to-list'
-- New Common-Lisp functions `some', `every', `notevery', `notany',
   `adjoin', `union', `intersection', `set-difference',
   `set-exclusive-or', `subsetp'
-- `remove-face-property' provides a clean way of removing a
   face property.

Many of the Emacs Lisp packages have been updated.  Some of the new
Emacs Lisp packages ---

ada-mode:  major mode for editing Ada source

arc-mode:  simple editing of archives

auto-show-mode:  automatically scrolls horizontally to keep point on-screen

completion:  dynamic word completion mode

dabbrev:  the dynamic abbrev package has been rewritten and is much
          more powerful -- e.g. it searches in other buffers as well
          as the current one

easymenu:  menu support package

live-icon:  makes frame icons represent the current frame contents

mailcrypt 3.2:  mail encryption with PGP; included but v2.4 is still
                the default

two-column:  for editing two-column text


** Major Differences Between 19.11 and 19.12
============================================

This is a huge new release.  Almost every aspect of XEmacs has been changed
at least somewhat.  The highlights are:

-- TTY support (includes face support)
-- new redisplay engine; should be faster, less buggy, and more powerful
-- terminology change from "screen" to "frame"
-- built-in toolbar
-- toolbar support added to many packages
-- multiple device support (still in beta; improvements to come in
   19.13)
-- Purify used to ensure that there are no memory leaks or memory corruption
   problems
-- horizontal and vertical scrollbars in all windows
-- new Lucid (i.e. look-alike Motif) scrollbar widget
-- stay-up menus in the Lucid (look-alike Motif) menubar widget
-- 3-d modeline
-- new extents engine; should be faster, less buggy, and more powerful
-- much more powerful control over faces
-- expanded menubar
-- more work on synching with GNU Emacs 19.28
-- new packages: Hyperbole, OOBR (object browser), hm--html-menus, viper,
   lazy-lock.el, ksh-mode.el, rsz-minibuf.el
-- package updates for all major packages
-- dynodump package for Solaris: provides proper undumping and portable
   binaries across different OS versions and machine types
-- Greatly expanded concept of "glyphs" (pixmaps etc. in a buffer)
-- built-in support for displaying X-Faces, if the X-Face library is
   available
-- built-in support for SOCKS if the SOCKS library is available
-- graceful behavior when the colormap is full (e.g. Netscape ate
   all the colors)
-- built-in MD5 (secure hashing function) support


More specific information:

*** TTY Support
---------------

The long-awaited TTY support is now available.  XEmacs will start up
in TTY mode (using the tty you started XEmacs from) if the DISPLAY
environment variable is not set or if you use the `-nw' option.

Faces are available on TTY's.  For a demonstration, try editing a C
file and turning on font-lock-mode.

You can also connect to additional TTY's using `make-tty-device',
whether your first frame was a TTY or an X window.  This ability is
not yet completely finished.

The full event-loop capabilities (processes, timeouts, etc.) are
available on TTY's.



*** New Redisplay Engine
------------------------

The redisplay engine has been rewritten to improve its efficiency and
to increase its functionality.  It should also be significantly more
bug-free than the previous redisplay engine.

A line that is not big enough to display at the bottom of the window
will normally be clipped (so that it is partially visible) rather than
not displayed at all.  The variable `pixel-vertical-clip-threshold'
can be used to control the minimum space that must be available for a
line to be clipped rather than not displayed at all.

Tabs are displayed in such a way that things line up fairly well even
in the presence of variable-width fonts and/or lines with
multiply-sized fonts.

Display tables are implemented, through the specifier variable
`current-display-table'.  They can be buffer-local, window-local,
frame-local, or device-local.  See below for info about specifiers.



*** Toolbar
-----------

There is now built-in support for a toolbar.  A sample toolbar is
visible by default at the top of the frame.  Four separate toolbars
can be configured (at the top, bottom, left, and right of the frame).
The toolbar specification is similar to the menubar specification.
The up, down, and disabled glyphs of a toolbar button can be
separately controlled.  Explanatory text can be echoed in the echo
area when the mouse passes over a toolbar button.  The size, contents,
and visibility of the various toolbars can be controlled on a
per-buffer, per-window, per-frame, and per-device basis through the
use of specifiers.  See the chapter on toolbars in the Lisp Reference
Manual (included with XEmacs) for more information.

The toolbar color and shadow thicknesses are currently controlled only
through `modify-frame-parameters' and through X resources.  We are
planning on making these controllable through specifiers as well. (Our
hope is to make `modify-frame-parameters' obsolete, as it is a clunky
and not very powerful mechanism.)

Info, GNUS, VM, W3, and various other packages include custom toolbars
with them.



*** Menubar
-----------

Stay-up menus are implemented in the look-alike Motif menubar.

The default menubar has been expanded to include most commonly-used
functions in XEmacs.

The options menu has been greatly expanded to include many more
options.

The menubar specification format has been greatly expanded.  Per-menu
activation hooks can be specified through the :filter keyword (thus
obsoleting `activate-menubar-hook'); this allows for fast response
time when you have a large and complex menu.  You can dynamically
control whether menu items are present through the :included and
:config keywords. (The latter keyword implements a simple menubar
configuration scheme, in conjunction with the variable
`menubar-configuration'.) Many different menu-item separators (single
or double line; solid or dashed; flat, etched-in, or etched-out) are
available.  See the chapter on menus in the Lisp Reference Manual for
more information about all of this.

New functions `add-submenu' and `add-menu-button' are available.
These supersede the older `add-menu' and `add-menu-item' functions,
and provide a more powerful and consistent interface.

New convenience functions for popping up the part or all of the
menubar in a pop-up menu are available: `popup-menubar-menu' and
`popup-buffer-menu'.

Menus are now incrementally constructed greatly improving menubar
response time.



*** Scrollbars
--------------

A look-alike Motif scrollbar is now included with XEmacs.  No longer
will you have to suffer with ugly Athena scrollbars.

Windows can now have horizontal scrollbars.  Normally they are visible
when the window's buffer is set to truncate lines rather than wrap
them (e.g. `(setq truncate-lines t)').

All windows, not only the right-most ones, can have vertical
scrollbars.

The functions to change a scrollbar's width have been superseded by
the specifier variables `scrollbar-width' and `scrollbar-height'.
This allows their values to be controlled on a buffer-local,
window-local, frame-local, and device-local basis.  See below.

The scrollbars interact better with the event loop (for example, you
can type `C-h k', do a scrollbar action, and see a description of this
scrollbar action printed as if you had pressed a key sequence or
selected a menu item).

The scrollbar behavior can be reprogrammed, by advising the
`scrollbar-*' functions.



*** Key Bindings
----------------

The oft-used function `goto-line' now has its own binding: M-g.

New bindings are available for scrolling the "other" window: M-next,
M-prior, M-home, M-end. (On many keyboards, `next' and `prior'
labelled `PgUp' and `PgDn'.)

You can reactivate a deactivated Zmacs region, without having any
other effects, with the binding M-C-z.

The bindings `M-u', `M-l', and `M-c' now work on the region (if a
region is active) or work on a word, as before.

Shift-Control-G forces a "critical quit", which drops immediately into
the debugger; see below.



*** Modeline
------------

The modeline can now have a 3-d look; this is enabled by default.  The
specifier variable `modeline-shadow-thickness' controls the size.

The modeline can now be turned off on a per-buffer, per-window,
per-frame, or per-device basis.  The specifier variable
`has-modeline-p' controls whether the modeline is visible.  See below
for details about the vastly powerful specifier mechanism.

The modeline functions and variables have been renamed to be
`*-modeline-*' rather than `*-mode-line-*'.  Aliases are provided for
all the old names.

Variable width fonts now work correctly when used in the modeline.



*** Minibuffer, Echo Area
-------------------------

The minibuffer is no longer constrained to be one line high.  The
package rsz-minibuf.el is included to automatically resize the
minibuffer when its contents are too big; enable this with
`resize-minibuffer-mode'.

The echo area is now a true buffer, called " *Echo Area*".  This
allows you to customize the echo area behavior through
before-change-functions and after-change-functions.



*** Specifiers
--------------

XEmacs has a new concept called "specifiers", used to configure most
display options (toolbar size and contents, scrollbar size, face
properties, modeline visibility and shadow-thickness, glyphs, display
tables, etc.).  We are planning on converting all display
characteristics to use specifiers, and obsoleting the clunky functions
`frame-parameters' and `modify-frame-parameters'.  Specifically:

-- You can specify values (called "instantiators") for particular
   "locales" (i.e. buffers, windows, frames, devices, or a global value).
   When determining what the actual value (or "instance") of a specifier
   is, the specifications that are provided are searched from most
   specific (i.e. buffer-local) to most general (i.e. global), looking
   for a matching one.

-- You can specify multiple instantiators for a particular locale.
   For example, when specifying what the foreground color of a face
   is in a particular buffer, you could specify two instantiators:
   "dark sea green" and "green".  The color would then be dark sea
   green on devices that recognize that color, and green on other
   devices.  You have effectively provided a fallback value to make
   sure you get reasonable behavior on all devices.

-- You can add one or more tags to an instantiator, where a tag
   is a symbol that has been previously registered with XEmacs.
   This allows you to identify your instantiators for later
   removal in a way that won't interfere with other applications
   using the same specifier.  Furthermore, particular tags can
   be restricted to match only particular sorts of devices.
   Any tagged instantiator will be ignored if the device over which
   it is being instanced does not match any of its tags.  This
   allows you, for example, to restrict an instantiator to a
   particular device type (X or TTY) and/or class (color, grayscale,
   or mono). (You might want to specify, for example, that a
   particular face is displayed in green on color devices and is
   underlined on mono devices.)

-- A full API is provided for manipulating specifiers, and full
   documentation is provided in the Lisp Reference Manual.



*** Basic Lisp Stuff
--------------------

Common-Lisp backquote syntax is recognized.  For example, the old
expression

(` (a b (, c)))

can now be written

`(a b ,c)

The old backquote syntax is still accepted.

The new function `type-of' returns a symbol describing the type of a
Lisp object (`integer', `string', `symbol', etc.)

Symbols beginning with a colon (called "keywords") are treated
specially in that they are automatically made self-evaluating when
they are interned into `obarray'.  The new function `keywordp' returns
whether a symbol begins with a colon.

`get', `put', and `remprop' have been generalized to allow you to set
and retrieve properties on many different kinds of objects: symbols,
strings, faces, glyphs, and extents (for extents, however, this is not
yet implemented).  They are joined by a new function `object-plist'
that returns all of the properties that have been set on an object.

New functions `plists-eq' and `plists-equal' are provided for
comparing property lists (a property list is an alternating list
of keys and values).

The Common-Lisp functions `caar', `cadr', `cdar', `cddr', `caaar', etc.
(up to four a's and/or d's), `first', `second', `third', etc. (up to
`tenth'), `last', `rest', and `endp' have been added, for more
convenient manipulation of lists.

New function `mapvector' maps over a sequence and returns a vector
of the results, analogous to `mapcar'.

New functions `rassoc', `remassoc', `remassq', `remrassoc', and
`remrassq' are provided for working with alists.

New functions `defvaralias', `variable-alias' and `indirect-variable'
are provided for creating variable aliases.

Strings have a modified-tick that is bumped every time a string
is modified in-place with `aset' or `fillarray'.  This is retrieved
with the new function `string-modified-tick'.

New macro `push' destructively adds an element to the beginning of a
list.  New macro `pop' destructively removes and returns the first
element of a list.



*** Buffers
-----------

Most functions that operate on buffer text now take an optional BUFFER
argument, specifying which buffer they operate on.  (Previously, they
always operated on the current buffer.)

The new function `transpose-regions' is provided, ported from GNU
Emacs.

The new function `save-current-buffer' works like `save-excursion'
but only saves the current buffer, not the location of point in
that buffer.



*** Devices
-----------

XEmacs has a new concept of "device", which is represents a particular
X display or TTY connection.  `make-frame' has a new, optional device
parameter that allows you to specify which device the frame is to be
created on.

Multiple simultaneous TTY and/or X connections may be made.  The
specifier mechanism provides reasonable behavior of glyphs, faces,
etc. over heterogeneous device types and over devices whose individual
capabilities may vary.

There is also a device type called "stream" that represents a STDIO
device that has no redisplay or cursor-motion capabilities, such as
the "glass terminal" that XEmacs uses when it is run noninteractively.
There is not all that much you can do with stream devices currently;
please let us know if there are good uses you can think of for this
capability. (For example, log files?)

A new device API is provided.  Functions are provided such as
`device-name' (the name of the device, which generally is based on the
X display or TTY file name), `device-type' (X, TTY, or stream),
`device-class' (color, grayscale, or mono), etc.  See the Lisp
Reference Manual.

Many functions have been extended to contain an additional, optional
device argument, where such an extension makes sense.  In general, if
the argument is omitted, it is equivalent to specifying
`(selected-device)'.

Many previous functions and variables are obsoleted in favor of the
device API.  For example, `window-system' is obsoleted by
`device-type', and `x-color-display-p' and friends are obsoleted by
`device-class'.

*** NOTE **: The obsolete variable `window-system' is going
to be deleted soon, probably in 19.14.  Please correct all
your code to use `device-type'.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The function `x-display-visual-class'
returns different values from previous versions of XEmacs.



*** Errors, Warnings, C-g
-------------------------

There is a new warnings system implemented.  Many warnings that were
formerly displayed in various ad-hoc ways (e.g. warnings about screwy
modifier mappings, messages about failures handling the mouse cursor
and errors in a gc-hook) have been regularized through this system.
The new function `warn' displays a warning before the next redisplay
(the actually display of the warning messages is accomplished through
`display-warning-buffer').  Both `warn' and `display-warning-buffer'
are Lisp functions (the C code calls out to them as necessary), and
thus you can customize the warning system.

Under an X display, you can press Shift-Control-G to force a "critical
quit".  This will immediately display a backtrace and pop you into the
debugger, regardless of the settings of `inhibit-quit' and
`debug-on-quit'.

C-g now works properly even on systems that don't implement SIGIO or
for which SIGIO is broken (e.g. IRIX 5.3 and older versions of Linux).
In addition, the SIGIO support has been fixed for many systems on
which it didn't always work properly before (e.g. HPUX and Solaris).



*** Events
----------

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: Many event functions have been changed to
accept and return windows instead of frames.

New function: `event-live-p', specifying whether `deallocate-event'
has been called on an event.

The "menu event" type has been renamed to "misc-user event", and
encompasses scrollbar events as well as menu events.  We are planning
on making it also encompass toolbar events in a future release.

New functions are provided for determining whether an particular
sections of a frame: `event-over-border-p', `event-over-glyph-p',
`event-over-modeline-p', `event-over-text-area-p', and
`event-over-toolbar-p'.  The old, kludgey methods of checking the
window-height, the internal-border-width, etc. are unreliable and
should not be used.

New functions `event-window-x-pixel' and `event-window-y-pixel' are
provided for determining where in a particular window an event
happened.

New functions `event-glyph-x-pixel' and `event-glyph-y-pixel' are
provided for determining where in a particular glyph an event
happened.

New function `event-closest-point', which returns the closest buffer
position to the event even if the event did not occur over any text.

New variable `unread-command-events', superseding the older
`unread-command-event'.

Many event-loop bugs have been fixed.



*** Extents
-----------

The extent code has been largely rewritten.  It should be faster and
more reliable.

The text-property implementation has been greatly improved.

Some new extent primitives are provided to return the position of the
next or previous property change in a buffer.

Extents can now have a parent specified; then all of its properties
(except for the buffer it's in and its position in that buffer) come
from that extent.  Hierarchies of such extents can be created.

Extents now have a `detachable' property that controls what happens
(they either get detached or shrink down to zero-length) when their
text is deleted.  Previously, such extents would always be detached.

The `invisible' property on extents now works.

`map-extents' has three additional parameters that provide more
control over which extents are mapped.

`map-extents' deals better with changes made to extents in the
buffer being mapped over.

A new function `mapcar-extents' (an alternative to `map-extents') has
been provided and should be easier to use than `map-extents'.



*** Faces
---------

Faces can now be buffer-local, window-local, and device-local as well
as frame-local, and can be further restricted to a particular device
type or class.  The way in which faces can be controlled is now based
on the general and powerful specifier mechanism; see above.

The new function `set-face-property' generalizes `set-face-font',
`set-face-foreground', etc. and takes many new optional arguments, in
accordance with the new specifier mechanism.

The new functions `face-property' and `face-property-instance'
generalize `face-font', `face-foreground', etc. and take many new
optional arguments, in accordance with the new specifier mechanism.
(`face-property' returns the value, if any, that was specified for a
particular locale, and `face-property-instance' returns the actual
value that will be used for display.  See the section on specifiers.)

The functions `face-font', `face-foreground', `face-background',
`set-face-font', `set-face-foreground', `set-face-background',
etc. are now convenience functions, trivially implemented using
`face-property' and `set-face-property' and take new optioanl
arguments in accordance with those functions.  New convenience
functions `face-font-instance', `face-foreground-instance',
`face-background-instance', etc. are provided and are trivially
implemented using `face-property-instance'.

Inheritance of face properties can now be specified.  Each individual
face property can inherit differently from other properties, or not
inherit at all.

You can set user-defined properties on faces using
`set-face-property'.

You can create "temporary" faces, which are faces that disappear
when they are no longer in use.  This is as opposed to normal
faces, which stay around forever.

The function `make-face' takes a new optional argument specifying
whether a face should be permanent or temporary, and returns the
actual face object rather than the face symbol, as in previous
versions of XEmacs.

The function `face-list' takes a new optional argument specifying
whether permanent, temporary, or both kinds of faces should be
returned.

Faces have new TTY-specific properties: `highlight', `reverse',
`alternate', `blinking', and `dim'.

Redisplay is smarter about dealing with face changes: changes to a
particular face no longer cause all frames to be cleared and
redisplayed.

The Edit-Faces package is provided for interactively changing faces.
A menu item on the options menu is provided for this.

New functions are provided for retrieving the ascent, descent, height,
and width of a character in a particular face.



*** Fonts, Colors
-----------------

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The old "font" and "pixel" objects are gone.
In place are new objects "font specifier", "font instance", "color
specifier", and "color instance".  Functions `font-name', `pixel-name'
(an obsolete alias for `color-name'), etc. are now convenience
functions for working with font and color specifiers.  Old code that
is not too sophisticated about working with font and pixel objects may
still work, though.  (For example, the idiom `(font-name (face-font
'default))' still works.)

You can now extract the RGB components of a color-instance object
(similar to the old pixel object) with the function
`color-instance-rgb-components'.  There is also a convenience function
`color-rgb-components' for working with color specifiers.

If there are no more colors available in the colormap, the nearest
existing color will be used when allocating a new color.



*** Frames
----------

What used to be called "screens" are now called "frames", for clarity
and consistency with GNU Emacs.  Aliases are provided for all the old
screen functions and variables, to avoid introducing a huge E-Lisp
incompatibility.

The frame code has been merged with GNU Emacs 19.28, providing
improved functionality for many functions.



*** Glyphs, Images, and Pixmaps
-------------------------------

Glyphs (used in various places, i.e. as begin-glyphs and end-glyphs
attached to extents and appearing in a buffer or in marginal
annotations; as the truncator and continuor glyphs marking line wrap
or truncation; as an overlay at the beginning of a line; as the
displayable element in a toolbar button; etc.) can now be
buffer-local, window-local, frame-local, and device-local, and can be
further restricted to a particular device type or class.  The way in
which faces can be controlled is now based on the general and powerful
specifier mechanism; see above.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The glyph and pixmap API has been completely
overhauled.  A new Lisp object "glyph" is provided and should be used
where the old "pixmap" object would have been used.  The pixmap object
exists no longer.  There are also new Lisp objects "image specifier"
and "image instance" (an image-instance is the closest equivalent to
what a pixmap object was).  More work on glyphs and images is slated
for 19.13.  The glyph and image docs in the Lisp Reference Manual are
incomplete and will be finished in 19.13.

The new function `set-glyph-property' allows setting of all the
glyph properties (`baseline', `contrib-p', etc.).  Convenience
functions for particular properties are also provided, just like
for faces.

You can set user-defined properties on glyphs using the new function
`set-glyph-property'.

When displaying pixmaps, existing, closest-matching colors will be
used if the colormap is full.

If the compface library is compiled into XEmacs, there is built-in
support for displaying X-Face bitmaps. (These are typically small
pictures of people's faces, included in a mail message through the
X-Face: header.) VM and highlight-headers will automatically use the
built-in X-Face support if it is available.

Annotations in the right margin (as well as the left margin) are now
implemented.  The left and right margin width functions have been
superseded by the specifier variables `left-margin-width' and
`right-margin-width', allowing much more flexible control through the
specifier mechanism.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The variable `use-left-overflow',
for controlling annotations in the left margin, is now a specifier
variable instead of a buffer-local variable.  (There is also a new
variable `use-right-overflow', that is complementary.)



*** Hashing
-----------

Two new types of weak hashtables can be created: key-weak and
value-weak.  In a key-weak hashtable, an entry remains around
if its key is referenced elsewhere, regardless of whether this
is also the case for the value.  Value-weak hashtables are
complementary. (This is as opposed to the traditional weak
hashtables, where an entry remains around only if both the
key and value are referenced elsewhere.) New functions
`make-key-weak-hashtable' and `make-value-weak-hashtable'
are provided for creating these hashtables.

The new function `md5' is provided for performing an MD5
hash of an object.  MD5 is a secure message digest algorithm
developed by RSA, inc.



*** Keymaps
-----------

The GNU Emacs concept of `function-key-map' is now partially
implemented.  This allows conversion of function-key escape sequences
such as `ESC [ 1 1 ~' into an equivalent human-readable keysym such as
`F1'.  This work will be completed in 19.14.  The function-key map is
device-local and controllable through the functions
`device-function-key-map' and `set-device-function-key-map'.

`where-is-internal' now correctly searches minor-mode keymaps,
extent-local keymaps, etc.  As a side effect of this, menu items will
now correctly show the keyboard equivalent for commands that are
available through a minor-mode keymap, extent-local keymap, etc.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The modifier key "Symbol" has
been renamed to "Alt", for compatibility with the rest of the world.
Keep in mind that on many keyboards, the key labelled "Alt" actually
generates the "Meta" modifier.  (On Sun keyboards, however, the key
labelled "Alt" does indeed generate the "Alt" modifier, and the key
labelled with a diamond generates the "Meta" modifier.)



*** Mouse, Active Region
------------------------

The mouse internals in mouse.el have been rewritten.  Hooks have been
provided for easier customization of mouse behavior.  For example, you
can now easily specify an action to be invoked on single-click
(i.e. down-up without appreciable motion), double-click, drag-up, etc.

Some code from GNU Emacs has been ported over, generalizing some of
the X-specific mouse stuff.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The function `set-mouse-position' accepts
a window instead of a frame.

New function `mouse-position' that obsoletes and is more powerful than
`read-mouse-position'.

New functions `mouse-pixel-positon' and `set-mouse-pixel-position' for
working with pixels instead of characters.

The active (Zmacs) region is now highlighted using the `zmacs-region-face'
instead of the `primary-selection-face'; this generalizes what used
to be X-specific.

New functions `region-active-p', `region-exists-p', and `activate-region'
provide a uniform API for dealing with the region irrespective of
whether the variable `zmacs-regions' is set.

XEmacs is now a better X citizen with respect to the primary selection:
it does not stomp on the primary selection quite so much.  This makes
things more manageable if you set `zmacs-regions' to nil.



*** Processes
-------------

Various process race conditions and bugs have been fixed.  Problems
with process termination not getting noticed until much later (if at
all) should be gone now, as well as problems with zombie processes
under some systems.

SOCKS support is now included.  SOCKS is a package that allows hosts
behind a firewall to gain full access to the Internet without
requiring direct IP reachability.



*** Windows
-----------

Windows 95 is still not out yet.

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE **: The functions `locate-window-from-coordinates'
and `window-edges' have been eliminated.  It no longer makes sense to
work with windows in terms of character positions, because windows can
(and often do) have many differently-sized fonts in them, because the
3-D modeline is not exactly one line high, etc.

The new functions `window-pixel-edges', `window-highest-p',
`window-lowest-p', `frame-highest-window', and `frame-lowest-window'
are provided as substitutes for the above-mentioned, deleted
functions.

The function `window-end' now takes an optional GUARANTEE argument
that will ensure that the value is actually correct as of the next
redisplay.

The window code has been merged with GNU Emacs 19.28, providing
improved functionality for many functions.



*** System-Specific Information
-------------------------------

Georg Nikodym's dynodump package is provided, for proper unexec()ing
on Solaris systems.  Executables built on Solaris 2.3 can now run on
Solaris 2.4 without crashing; similarly with executables built on one
type of Sun machine and run on another.

AIX 4.x is supported.

The NeXTstep operating system is supported in TTY mode (this is still
in beta).  There are plans to port XEmacs to the NeXTstep window
system, but it may be awhile before this is complete.

Problems with the `round' function causing arithmetic errors on HPUX 9
have been fixed.

You can now build XEmacs as an ELF executable on Linux systems that
support ELF.

Various other new system configurations are supported.




** Major Differences Between 19.10 and 19.11
============================================

The name has changed from "Lucid Emacs" to "XEmacs".  Along with this is a
new canonical ftp site: cs.uiuc.edu:/pub/xemacs.

XEmacs now has its very own World Wide Web page!  It contains a
complete list of the FTP distribution sites, the most recent FAQ,
pointers to Emacs Lisp packages not included with the distribution, and
other useful stuff.  Check it out at http://xemacs.cs.uiuc.edu/.

A preliminary New Users Guide.

cc-mode.el now provides the default C, C++ and Objective-C modes.

The primary goal of this release is stability.  Very few new features have
been introduced but lots of bugs have been fixed.  Many of the Emacs Lisp
packages have been updated.

Some of the new Emacs Lisp packages ---

tcl-mode.el:  major mode for editing TCL code

fast-lock.el: saves and restores font-lock highlighting, greatly
            reducing the time necessary for loading a font-lock'ed
            file

ps-print.el: prints buffers to Postscript printers preserving the
           buffer's bold and italic text attributes

toolbar.el: provides a "fake" toolbar for use with XEmacs (an
          integrated one will be included with 19.12)


** Major Differences Between 19.9 and 19.10
===========================================

The GNU `configure' system is now used to build lemacs.

The Emacs Manual and Emacs Lisp Reference Manual now document version 19.10.
If you notice any errors, please let us know.

When pixmaps are displayed in a buffer, they contribute to the line height -
that is, if the glyph is taller than the rest of the text on the line, the
line will be as tall as necessary to display the glyph.

In addition to using arbitrary sound files as emacs beeps, one can control
the pitch and duration of the standard X beep, on X servers which allow that
(Note: most don't.)

There is support for playing sounds on systems with NetAudio servers.

Minor modes may have mode-specific key bindings; keymaps may have an arbitrary
number of parent maps.

Menus can have toggle and radio buttons in them.

There is a font selection menu.

Some default key bindings have changed to match FSF19; the new bindings are

  Screen-related commands:
        C-x 5 2                 make-screen
        C-x 5 0                 delete-screen
        C-x 5 b                 switch-to-buffer-other-screen
        C-x 5 f                 find-file-other-screen
        C-x 5 C-f               find-file-other-screen
        C-x 5 m                 mail-other-screen
        C-x 5 o                 other-screen
        C-x 5 r                 find-file-read-only-other-screen
  Abbrev-related commands:
        C-x a l                 add-mode-abbrev
        C-x a C-a               add-mode-abbrev
        C-x a g                 add-global-abbrev
        C-x a +                 add-mode-abbrev
        C-x a i g               inverse-add-global-abbrev
        C-x a i l               inverse-add-mode-abbrev
        C-x a -                 inverse-add-global-abbrev
        C-x a e                 expand-abbrev
        C-x a '                 expand-abbrev
  Register-related commands:
        C-x r C-SPC             point-to-register
        C-x r SPC               point-to-register
        C-x r j                 jump-to-register
        C-x r s                 copy-to-register
        C-x r x                 copy-to-register
        C-x r i                 insert-register
        C-x r g                 insert-register
        C-x r r                 copy-rectangle-to-register
        C-x r c                 clear-rectangle
        C-x r k                 kill-rectangle
        C-x r y                 yank-rectangle
        C-x r o                 open-rectangle
        C-x r t                 string-rectangle
        C-x r w                 window-configuration-to-register
  Narrowing-related commands:
        C-x n n                 narrow-to-region
        C-x n w                 widen
  Other changes:
        C-x 3                   split-window-horizontally (was undefined)
        C-x -                   shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer
        C-x +                   balance-windows

The variable allow-deletion-of-last-visible-screen has been removed, since
it was widely hated.  You can now always delete the last visible screen if
there are other iconified screens in existence.

ToolTalk support is provided.

An Emacs screen can be placed within an "external client widget" managed
by another application.  This allows an application to use an Emacs screen
as its text pane rather than the standard Text widget that is provided
with Motif or Athena.

Additional compatibility with Epoch is provided (though this is not yet
complete.)


** Major Differences Between 19.8 and 19.9
==========================================

Scrollbars!  If you have Motif, these are real Motif scrollbars; otherwise,
Athena scrollbars are used.  They obey all the usual resources of their
respective toolkits.

There is now an implementation of dialog boxes based on the Athena
widgets, as well as the existing Motif implementation.

This release works with Motif 1.2 as well as 1.1.  If you link with Motif,
you do not also need to link with Athena.

If you compile lwlib with both USE_MOTIF and USE_LUCID defined (which is the
recommended configuration) then the Lucid menus will draw text using the Motif
string-drawing library, instead of the Xlib one.  The reason for this is that
one can take advantage of the XmString facilities for including non-Latin1
characters in resource specifications.  However, this is a user-visible change
in that, in this configuration, the menubar will use the "*fontList" resource
in preference to the "*font" resource, if it is set.

It's possible to make extents which are copied/pasted by kill and undo.
There is an implementation of FSF19-style text properties based on this.

There is a new variable, minibuffer-max-depth, which is intended to circumvent
a common source of confusion among new Emacs users.  Since, under a window
system, it's easy to jump out of the minibuffer (by doing M-x, then getting
distracted, and clicking elsewhere) many, many novice users have had the
problem of having multiple minibuffers build up, even to the point of
exhausting the lisp stack.  So the default behavior is to disallow the
minibuffer to ever be reinvoked while active; if you attempt to do so, you
will be prompted about it.

There is a new variable, teach-extended-commands-p, which if set, will cause
`M-x' to remind you of any key bindings of the command you just invoked the
"long way."

There are menus in Dired, Tar, Comint, Compile, and Grep modes.

There is a menu of window management commands on the right mouse button over
the modelines.

Popup menus now have titles at the top; this is controlled by the new
variable `popup-menu-titles'.

The `Find' key on Sun keyboards will search for the next (or previous)
occurrence of the selected text, as in OpenWindows programs.

The `timer' package has been renamed to `itimer' to avoid a conflict with
a different package called `timer'.

VM 5.40 is included.

W3, the emacs interface to the World Wide Web, is included.

Felix Lee's GNUS speedups have been installed, including his new version of
nntp.el which makes GNUS efficiently utilize the NNTP XOVER command if
available (which is much faster.)

GNUS should also be much friendlier to new users: it starts up much faster,
and doesn't (necessarily) subscribe you to every single newsgroup.

The byte-compiler issues a new class of warnings: variables which are
bound but not used.  This is merely an advisory, and does not mean the
code is incorrect; you can disable these warnings in the usual way with
the `byte-compiler-options' macro.

the `start-open' and `end-open' extent properties, for specifying whether
characters inserted exactly at a boundary of an extent should go into the
extent or out of it, now work correctly.

The `extent-data' slot has been generalized/replaced with a property list,
so it's easier to attach arbitrary data to extent objects.

The `event-modifiers' and `event-modifier-bits' functions work on motion
events as well as other mouse and keyboard events.

Forms-mode uses fonts and read-only regions.

The behavior of the -geometry command line option should be correct now.

The `iconic' screen parameter works when passed to x-create-screen.

The user's manual now documents Lucid Emacs 19.9.

The relocating buffer allocator is turned on by default; this means that when
buffers are killed, their storage will be returned to the operating system,
and the size of the emacs process will shrink.

CAVEAT: code which contains calls to certain `face' accessor functions will
need to be recompiled by version 19.9 before it will work.  The functions
whose callers must be recompiled are: face-font, face-foreground,
face-background, face-background-pixmap, and face-underline-p.  The symptom
of this problem is the error "Wrong type argument, arrayp, #<face ... >".
The .elc files generated by version 19.9 will work in 19.6 and 19.8, but
older .elc files which contain calls to these functions will not work in 19.9.

Work In Progress:

 - We have been in the process of internationalizing Lucid Emacs.  This code is
   ***not*** ready for general use yet.  However, the code is included (and
   turned off by default) in this release.

   - If you define I18N2 at compile-time, then sorting/collation will be done
     according to the locale returned by setlocale().

   - If you define I18N3 at compile-time, then all messages printed by lemacs
     will be filtered through the gettext() library routine, to enable the use
     of locale-specific translation catalogues.  The current implementation of
     this is quite dependent on Solaris 2, and has a very large impact on
     existing code, therefore we are going to be making major changes soon.
     (You'll notice calls to `gettext' and `GETTEXT' scattered around much of
     the lisp and C code; ignore it, this will be going away.)

   - If you define I18N4 at compile-time, then lemacs will internally use a
     wide representation of characters, enabling the use of large character
     sets such as Kanji.  This code is very OS dependent: it requires X11R5,
     and several OS-supplied library routines for reading and writing wide
     characters (getwc(), putwc(), and a few others.)  Performance is also a
     problem.  This code is also scheduled for a major overhaul, with the
     intent of improving performance and portability.

     Our eventual goal is to merge with MULE, or at least provide the same base
     level of functionality.  If you would like to help out with this, let us
     know.

 - Other work-in-progress includes Motif drag-and-drop support, ToolTalk
   support, and support for embedding an Emacs widget inside another
   application (where it can function as that other application's text-entry
   area).  This code has not been extensively tested, and may (or may not)
   have portability problems, but it's there for the adventurous.  Comments,
   suggestions, bug reports, and especially fixes are welcome.  But have no
   expectations that this experimental code will work at all.


** Major Differences Between 19.6 and 19.8
==========================================

There were almost no differences between versions 19.6 and 19.7; version 19.7
was a bug-fix release that was distributed with Energize 2.1.

Lucid Emacs 19.8 represents the first stage of the Lucid Emacs/Epoch merger.
The redisplay engine now in lemacs is an improved descendant of the Epoch
redisplay.  As a result, many bugs have been eliminated, and several disabled
features have been re-enabled.  Notably:

Selective display (and outline-mode) work.

Horizontally split windows work.

The height of a line is the height of the tallest font displayed on that line;
it is possible for a screen to display lines of differing heights. (Previously,
the height of all lines was the height of the tallest font loaded.)

There is lisp code to scale fonts up and down, for example, to load the next-
taller version of a font.

There is a new internal representation for lisp objects, giving emacs-lisp 28
bit integers and a 28 bit address space, up from the previous maximum of 26.
We expect eventually to increase this to 30 bit integers and a 32 bit address
space, eliminating the need for DATA_SEG_BITS on some architectures.  (On 64
bit machines, add 32 to all of these numbers.)

GC performance is improved.

Various X objects (fonts, colors, cursors, pixmaps) are accessible as first-
class lisp objects, with finalization.

An alternate interface to embedding images in the text is provided, called
"annotations."  You may create an "annotation margin" which is whitespace at
the left side of the screen that contains only annotations, not buffer text.

When using XPM files, one can specify the values of logical color names to be
used when loading the files.

It is possible to resize windows by dragging their modelines up and down.  More
generally, it is possible to add bindings for mouse gestures on the modelines.

There is support for playing sound files on HP machines.

ILISP version 5.5 is included.

The Common Lisp #' read syntax is supported (#' is to "function" as ' is to
"quote".)

The `active-p' slot of menu items is now evaluated, so one can put arbitrary
lisp code in a menu to decide whether that item should be selectable, rather
than doing this with an `activate-menubar-hook'.

The X resource hierarchy has changed slightly, to be more consistent.  It used
to be
        argv[0]                 SCREEN-NAME     pane    screen
        ApplicationShell        EmacsShell      Paned   EmacsFrame

   now it is

        argv[0]                 shell           pane    SCREEN-NAME
        ApplicationShell        EmacsShell      Paned   EmacsFrame

The Lucid Emacs sources have been largely merged with FSF version 19; this
means that the lisp library contains the most recent releases of various
packages, and many new features of FSF 19 have been incorporated.

Because of this, the lemacs sources should also be substantially more portable.


** Major Differences Between 19.4 and 19.6
==========================================

There were almost no differences between versions 19.4 and 19.5; we fixed
a few minor bugs and repacked 19.4 as 19.5 for a CD-ROM that we gave away
as a trade show promotion.

The primary goal of the 19.6 release is stability, rather than improved
functionality, so there aren't many user-visible changes.  The most notable
changes are:

 - The -geometry command-line option now correctly overrides geometry
   specifications in the resource database.
 - The `width' and `height' screen-parameters work.
 - Font-lock-mode considers the comment start and end characters to be
   a part of the comment.
 - The lhilit package has been removed.  Use font-lock-mode instead.
 - vm-isearch has been fixed to work with isearch-mode.
 - new versions of ispell and calendar.
 - sccs.el has menus.

Lots of bugs were fixed, including the problem that lemacs occasionally
grabbed the keyboard focus.

Also, as of Lucid Emacs 19.6 and Energize 2.0 (shipping now) it is possible
to compile the public release of Lucid Emacs with support for Energize; so
now Energize users will be able to build their own Energize-aware versions
of lemacs, and will be able to use newer versions of lemacs as they are
released to the net.  (Of course, this is not behavior covered by your
Energize support contract; you do it at your own risk.)

I have not incorporated all portability patches that I have been sent since
19.4; I will try to get to them soon.  However, if you need to make any
changes to lemacs to get it to compile on your system, it would be quite
helpful if you would send me context diffs (diff -c) against version 19.6.


** Major Differences Between 19.3 and 19.4
==========================================

Prototypes have been added for all functions.  Emacs compiles in the strict
ANSI modes of lcc and gcc, so portability should be vastly improved.

Many many many many core leaks have been plugged, especially in screen
creation and deletion.

The float support reworked to be more portable and ANSI conformant.  This
resulted in these new configuration parameters: HAVE_INVERSE_HYPERBOLIC,
HAVE_CBRT, HAVE_RINT, FLOAT_CHECK_ERRNO, FLOAT_CATCH_SIGILL,
FLOAT_CHECK_DOMAIN.  Let us know if you had to change the defaults on your
architecture.

The SunOS unexec has been rewritten, and now works with either static or
dynamic libraries, depending on whether -Bstatic or -Bdynamic were specified
at link-time.

Small (character-sized) bitmaps can be mixed in with buffer text via the new
functions set-extent-begin-glyph and set-extent-end-glyph.  (This is actually
a piece of functionality that Energize has been using for a while, but we've
just gotten around to making it possible to use it without Energize.  See how
nice we are?  Go buy our product.)

If compiled with Motif support, one can pop up dialog boxes from emacs lisp.
We encourage someone to contribute Athena an version of this code; it
shouldn't be much work.

If dialog boxes are available, then y-or-n-p and yes-or-no-p use dialog boxes
instead of the minibuffer if invoked as a result of a command that was
executed from a menu instead of from the keyboard.

Multiple screen support works better; check out doc of get-screen-for-buffer.

The default binding of backspace is the same as delete.  (C-h is still help.)

A middle click while the minibuffer is active does completion if you click on
a highlighted completion, otherwise it executes the global binding of button2.

New versions of Barry Warsaw's c++-mode and syntax.c.  Font-lock-mode works
with C++ mode now.

The semantics of activate-menubar-hook has changed; the functions are called
with no arguments now.

`truename' no longer hacks the automounter; use directory-abbrev-alist instead.

Most minibuffer handling has been reimplemented in emacs-lisp.

There is now a builtin minibuffer history mechanism which replaces gmhist.


** Major Differences Between 19.2 and 19.3
==========================================

The ISO characters have correct case and syntax tables now, so the word-motion
and case-converting commands work sensibly on them.

If you set ctl-arrow to an integer, you can control exactly which characters
are printable.  (There will be a less crufty way to do this eventually.)

Menubars can now be buffer local; the function set-screen-menubar no longer
exists.  Look at GNUS and VM for examples of how to do this, or read
menubar.el.

When emacs is reading from the minibuffer with completions, any completions
which are visible on the screen will highlight when the mouse moves over them;
clicking middle on a completion is the same as typing it at the minibuffer.
Some implications of this:  The *Completions* buffer is always mousable.  If
you're using the completion feature of find-tag, your source code will be
mousable when you type M-.  Dired buffers will be mousable as soon as you
type ^X^F.  And so on.

The old isearch code has been replaced with a descendant of Dan LaLiberte's
excellent isearch-mode; it is more customizable, and generally less bogus.
You can search for "composed" characters.  There are new commands, too; see
the doc for ^S, or the NEWS file.

A patched GNUS 3.14 is included.

The user's manual now documents Lucid Emacs 19.3.

A few more modes have mouse and menu support.

The startup code should be a little more robust, and give you more reasonable
error messages when things aren't installed quite right (instead of the
ubiquitous "cannot open DISPLAY"...)

Subdirectories of the lisp directory whose names begin with a hyphen or dot
are not automatically added to the load-path, so you can use this to avoid
accidentally inflicting experimental software on your users.

I've tried to incorporate all of the portability patches that were sent to
me; I tried to solve some of the problems in different ways than the
patches did, so let me know if I missed something.

Some systems will need to define NEED_STRDUP, NEED_REALPATH, HAVE_DREM, or
HAVE_REMAINDER in config.h.  Really this should be done in the appropriate
s- or m- files, but I don't know which systems need these and which don't.
If yours does, let me know which file it should be in.

Check out these new packages:

blink-paren.el: causes the matching parenthesis to flash on and off whenever
                the cursor is sitting on a paren-syntax character.

pending-del.el: Certain commands implicitly delete the highlighted region:
                Typing a character when there is a highlighted region replaces
                that region with the typed character.

font-lock.el:   A code-highlighting package, driven off of syntax tables, so
                that it understands block comments, strings, etc.  The
                insertion hook is used to fontify text as you type it in.

shell-font.el:  Displays your shell-buffer prompt in boldface.
