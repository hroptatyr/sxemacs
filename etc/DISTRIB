	   SXEmacs availability information.  Last Modified: 29-Dec-04.

SXEmacs is available primarily via the GNU/arch repositories.  The
main repository is:

     steve@sxemacs.org--2004 http://arch.sxemacs.org/2004/

The following tla (Tom Lord's Arch) commands will "check out" the
lastest SXEmacs sources from the above repository:

(assumes that you have already installed and configured tla)

	$ tla register-archive steve@sxemacs.org--2004 \
	    http://arch.sxemacs.org/2004/

	$ tla get -A steve@sxemacs.org--2004 \
	    sxemacs--main--22.1.0 sxemacs-main

That will "check out" the lastest SXEmacs sources and place them into
$PWD/sxemacs-main/ 

After that you can keep your working directory up to date with `tla
update'.

In the future we will be making source tarballs available for download
via anonymous FTP (and possibly via HTTP as well).  When that happens
these notes will be updated.
