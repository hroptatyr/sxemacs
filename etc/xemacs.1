.SH DESCRIPTION
.I XEmacs
is a version of
.IR Emacs ,
compatible with and containing many improvements over
.I GNU
.IR Emacs ,
written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation.  It was
originally based on an early release of
.I GNU Emacs Version
.IR 19 ,
and has tracked subsequent releases of
.I GNU Emacs
as they have become available.
.PP
The primary documentation of
.I XEmacs
is in the
.I XEmacs Reference
.IR Manual ,
which you can read on-line using Info, a subsystem of
.IR XEmacs .
Please look there for complete and up-to-date documentation.
Complete documentation on using Emacs Lisp is available on-line
through the
.I XEmacs Lisp Programmer's
.IR Manual .
Both manuals also can be printed out nicely using the
.I TeX
formatting package.
.PP
The user functionality of
.I XEmacs
encompasses everything other
.I Emacs
editors do, and it is easily extensible since its
editing commands are written in Lisp.
.PP
.I XEmacs
has an extensive interactive help facility,
but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate
.I XEmacs
windows and buffers.
CTRL-h enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t)
requests an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals
of
.I XEmacs
in a few minutes.
Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you
find a command given its functionality, Help Key Binding (CTRL-h k)
describes a given key sequence's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f)
describes a given Lisp function specified by name.  You can also
look up key sequences in the
.I XEmacs Reference Manual
using Lookup Key Binding (CTRL-h CTRL-k),
and look up Lisp functions in the
.I XEmacs Lisp Programmer's Manual
using Lookup Function (CTRL-h CTRL-f).  All of these help functions,
and more, are available on the Help menu if you are using a window
system.
.PP
.I XEmacs
has extensive GUI (graphical user interface) support when running under
a window system such as
.IR X ,
including multiple frames (top-level windows), a menubar, a toolbar,
horizontal and vertical scrollbars, dialog boxes, and extensive mouse
support.
.PP
.I XEmacs
has full support for multiple fonts and colors, variable-width fonts,
and variable-height lines, and allows for pixmaps to be inserted into
a buffer. (This is used in the W3 web-browsing package and in some
of the debugger and outlining interfaces, among other things.)
.PP
.IR XEmacs 's
Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is
easy to recover from editing mistakes.
.PP
.IR XEmacs 's
many special packages handle mail reading (VM, MH-E and RMail) and
sending (Mail), Usenet news reading and posting (GNUS), World Wide Web
browsing (W3), specialized modes for editing source code in all common
programming languages, syntax highlighting for many languages
(Font-Lock), compiling (Compile), running subshells within
.I XEmacs
windows (Shell), outline editing (Outline), running a Lisp read-eval-print
loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).
.PP
There is an extensive reference manual, but users of other Emacsen
should have little trouble adapting even without a copy.  Users new to
Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying
the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.
.PP
.SM XEmacs Options
.PP
XEmacs accepts all standard X Toolkit command line options when run in
an X Windows environment.  In addition, the following options are accepted
(when options imply a sequence of actions to perform, they are
performed in the order encountered):
.TP 8
.BI \-t " file"
Use specified
.I file
as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.  This implies
.BR \-nw \.
.TP
.BI \-batch
Edit in batch mode.  The editor will send messages to stdout.  You
must use the
.BR \-l ,
.BR \-f ,
and
.B \-eval
options to specify files to execute and functions to call.
.TP
.B \-nw
Inhibit the use of any window-system-specific display code: use the
current TTY.
.TP
.B \-debug\-init
Enter the debugger if an error occurs loading the init file.
.TP
.B \-unmapped
Do not map the initial frame.
.TP
.B \-no\-site\-file
Do not load the site-specific init file (site-start.el).
.TP
.B \-q, \-no\-init\-file
Do not load an init file.
.TP
.B \-no-early-packages
Do not process the early packages.
.TP
.B \-vanilla
Load no extra files at startup.  Equivalent to the combination of
.B \-q
,
.B \-no-site-file
, and
.B \-no-early-packages
\.
.TP
.BI \-u " user, " \-user " user"
Load
.IR user 's
init file.
.TP 8
.I file
Edit
.IR file \.
.TP
.BI \+ number
Go to the line specified by
.I number
(do not insert a space between the "+" sign and the number).
.TP
.B \-help
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-version,
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
.BI \-f " function, " \-funcall " function"
Execute the lisp function
.IR function \.
.TP
.BI \-l " file, " \-load " file"
Load the Lisp code in the file
.IR file \.
.TP
.BI \-eval " form"
Evaluate the Lisp form
.IR form \.
.TP
.BI \-i " file, " \-insert " file"
Insert
.I file
into the current buffer.
.TP
.B \-kill
Exit
.I XEmacs
(useful with
.BR \-batch ).
.PP
.SM Using XEmacs with X Windows
.PP
.I XEmacs
has been tailored to work well with the X window system.
If you run
.I XEmacs
from under X windows, it will create its own X window to display in.
.PP
.I XEmacs
can be started with the following standard X options:
.TP
.BI \-visual " <visualname><bitdepth>"
Select the visual that XEmacs will attempt to use.
.I <visualname>
should be one of the strings "StaticColor", "TrueColor", "GrayScale",
"PseudoColor" or "DirectColor", and
.I <bitdepth>
should be the number of bits per pixel (example, "-visual TrueColor24"
for a 24bit TrueColor visual) See
.IR X (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B -privateColormap
Require XEmacs to create and use a private colormap for display.  This
will keep XEmacs from taking colors from the default colormap and
keeping them from other clients, at the cost of causing annoying
flicker when the focus changes.  Use this option only if your X server
does not support 24 bit visuals.
.TP
.BI \-geometry " ##x##+##+##"
Specify the geometry of the initial window.  The ##'s represent a number;
the four numbers are width (characters), height (characters), X offset
(pixels), and Y offset (pixels), respectively.  Partial specifications of
the form
.I ##x##
or
.I +##+##
are also allowed. (The geometry
specification is in the standard X format; see
.IR X (1)
for more information.)
.TP
.B \-iconic
Specifies that the initial window should initially appear iconified.
.TP 8
.BI \-name " name"
Specifies the program name which should be used when looking up
defaults in the user's X resources.
.TP
.BI \-title " title, " \-T " title, " \-wn " title"
Specifies the title which should be assigned to the
.I XEmacs
window.
.TP
.BI \-d " displayname, " \-display " displayname"
Create the
.I XEmacs
window on the display specified by
.IR displayname .
Must be the first option specified in the command line.
.TP
.BI \-font " font, " \-fn " font"
Set the
.I XEmacs
window's font to that specified by
.IR font \.
You will find the various
.I X
fonts in the
.I /usr/lib/X11/fonts
directory.
.I XEmacs
works with either fixed- or variable-width fonts, but will probably
look better with a fixed-width font.
.TP
.BI \-scrollbar\-width " pixels"
Specify the width of the vertical scrollbars.
.TP
.BI \-scrollbar\-height " pixels"
Specify the height of the horizontal scrollbars.
.TP
.BI \-bw " pixels, " \-borderwidth " pixels"
Set the
.I XEmacs
window's border width to the number of pixels specified by
.IR pixels \.
Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.
.TP
.BI \-ib " pixels, " \-internal\-border\-width " pixels"
Specify the width between a frame's border and its text, in pixels.
Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.
.TP
.BI \-fg " color, " \-foreground " color"
Sets the color of the text.

See the file
.I /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
for a list of valid
color names.
.TP
.BI \-bg " color, " \-background " color"
Sets the color of the window's background.
.TP
.BI \-bd " color, " \-bordercolor " color"
Sets the color of the window's border.
.TP
.BI \-mc " color"
Sets the color of the mouse pointer.
.TP
.BI \-cr " color"
Sets the color of the text cursor.
.TP
.B \-rv, \-reverse
Reverses the foreground and background colors (reverse video).  Consider
explicitly setting the foreground and background colors instead of using
this option.
.TP
.BI \-xrm " argument"
This allows you to set an arbitrary resource on the command line.
.I argument
should be a resource specification, as might be found in your
.I \.Xresources
or
.I \.Xdefaults
file.
.PP
You can also set resources, i.e.
.I X
default values, for your
.I XEmacs
windows in your
.I \.Xresources
or
.I \.Xdefaults
file (see
.IR xrdb (1)).
Use the following format:
.IP
Emacs.keyword:value
.PP
or
.IP
Emacs*EmacsFrame.keyword:value
.PP
where
.I value
specifies the default value of
.IR keyword \.
(Some resources need the former format; some the latter.)
.PP
You can also set resources for a particular frame by using the
format
.IP
Emacs*framename.keyword:value
.PP
where
.I framename
is the resource name assigned to that particular frame.
(Certain packages, such as VM, give their frames unique resource
names, in this case "VM".)
.PP
.I XEmacs
lets you set default values for the following keywords:
.TP 8
.B default.attributeFont (\fPclass\fB Face.AttributeFont)
Sets the window's text font.
.TP
.B default.attributeForeground (\fPclass\fB Face.AttributeForeground)

.SH FILES
Lisp code is read at startup from the user's init file,
\fB$HOME/.emacs\fP.

/usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation browser
(a subsystem of
.IR XEmacs )
to refer to.  The complete text of the
.I XEmacs Reference Manual
and the
.I XEmacs Lisp Programmer's Manual
is included in a convenient tree structured form.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/info - the Info files may be here instead.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/lisp/* - Lisp source files and compiled files
that define most editing commands.  The files are contained in subdirectories,
categorized by function or individual package.  Some are preloaded;
others are autoloaded from these directories when used.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/etc - some files of information, pixmap
files, other data files used by certain packages, etc.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/$CONFIGURATION - various programs that are used
with XEmacs.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/$CONFIGURATION/DOC -
contains the documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and
preloaded Lisp functions of \fIXEmacs\fP.
They are stored here to reduce the size of \fIXEmacs\fP proper.

/usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp - locally-provided Lisp files.
.PP
.SH BUGS AND HELP
There is a newsgroup, comp.emacs.xemacs, for reporting
.I XEmacs
bugs and fixes and requesting help.  But before reporting something
as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is a bug, not a
misunderstanding or a deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section
``Reporting XEmacs Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info
system) for hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the version
number of the
.I XEmacs
you are running and the system you are running it on
in \fIevery\fR bug report that you send in.  Finally, the more you can
isolate the cause of a bug and the conditions it happens under, the more
likely it is to be fixed, so please take the time to do so.

The newsgroup is bidirectionally gatewayed to and from the mailing list
xemacs@xemacs.org.  You can read the list instead of the newsgroup if
you do not have convenient Usenet news access.  To request to be added
to the mailing list, send mail to xemacs-request@xemacs.org. (Do not
send mail to the list itself.)

The
.I XEmacs
maintainers read the newsgroup regularly and will attempt to
fix bugs reported in a timely fashion.  However, not every message will
get a response from one of the maintainers.  Note that there are many
people other than the maintainers who read the newsgroup, and will usually
be of assistance in helping with any problems encountered.

If you need more personal assistance than can be provided by the
newsgroup, look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people
who offer it.

It was based on an early version of
.I GNU Emacs Version
.IR 19 ,
written by Richard Stallman <rms@gnu.org> of the Free Software
Foundation, and has tracked subsequent releases of
.I GNU Emacs
as they have become available.  It was originally written by Lucid, Inc.

Chuck Thompson wrote the
.I XEmacs
redisplay engine, maintains the
.I XEmacs
FTP and WWW sites, and has put out all releases of
.I XEmacs
since 19.11 (the first release called
.IR XEmacs ).
Ben Wing wrote the Asian-language support, the on-line documentation
(including this man page and much of the FAQ), the external widget code,
and retooled or rewrote most of the basic, low-level
.I XEmacs
subsystems.  Jamie Zawinski put out all releases of
.I Lucid
.IR Emacs ,
from the first (19.0) through the last (19.10), and was the primary
code contributor for all of these releases.  Richard Mlynarik rewrote
the
.I XEmacs
Lisp-object allocation system, improved the keymap and minibuffer code,
and did the initial synching of
.I XEmacs
with
.I GNU Emacs Version
.IR 19 \.
