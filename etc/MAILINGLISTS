  sxemacs-devel is an open list for bug reports and general
  communication about development versions of SXEmacs.

sxemacs-patches@sxemacs.org

  sxemacs-patches is an open list for submission of patches to the
  SXEmacs distribution.

Subscriptions:

Subscription to all the lists is accomplished by sending an email
message to LISTNAME-request@sxemacs.org with `subscribe' (without the
quotes) as the BODY of the message.

To unsubscribe, send an email to LISTNAME-request@sxemacs.org with
`unsubscribe' (without the quotes) as the BODY of the message.

List Archives:

A browsable archive of these lists is available at

Problems:

Any comments, questions, or complaints about the lists should be
brought to the attention of the SXEmacs Mailing List Owner

The SXEmacs project is separate from and not managed by the XEmacs project
or the GNU project.
