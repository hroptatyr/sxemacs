	SXEmacs Electronic Mailing Lists.  Last Modified: 2006-12-05

SXEmacs has its own mailing lists which are distinct from the XEmacs and
the FSF GNU Emacs mailing lists and newsgroups.  The mailing lists are: 

sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org

  sxemacs-devel is a list for bug reports and general
  communication about development versions of SXEmacs.

sxemacs-patches@sxemacs.org

  sxemacs-patches is a list for submission of patches to the
  SXEmacs distribution.

sxemacs-builds@sxemacs.org

  sxemacs-builds is a list for the submission of "build reports".  See
  `C-h f build-rpt'.

Subscriptions:
-------------
Subscription to all the lists is accomplished by sending an email
message to LISTNAME-request@sxemacs.org with `subscribe' (without the
quotes) as the BODY of the message.

To unsubscribe, send an email to LISTNAME-request@sxemacs.org with
`unsubscribe' (without the quotes) as the BODY of the message.

List Archives:
-------------
A browsable archive of these lists is available at
http://www.sxemacs.org/list-archives/html/LISTNAME/

Problems:
--------
Any comments, questions, or complaints about the lists should be
brought to the attention of the SXEmacs Mailing List Owner
<LISTNAME-owner@sxemacs.org>.

SPAM:
----
It's a horrible problem, world wide.  The SXEmacs mailing lists have
not gone unnoticed by Mr Inconsiderate Spammer.  In an attempt to
reduce spam hitting our mailing lists, we've been forced to make the
lists all "member only".  This means that only subscribers can post to
the lists.

Inconvenient?  Yes, it is somewhat (especially for the list moderator),
but the upside is that since we switched to a "member only" policy the
lists have been virtually spam free.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The SXEmacs project is separate from and not managed by the XEmacs project
or the GNU project.

Please do NOT send messages about problems with SXEmacs to either the
FSF GNU Emacs newsgroups and mailing lists or the XEmacs lists and
newsgroups.
