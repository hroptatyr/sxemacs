* Introduction
==============

This file presents the changes in recent SXEmacs versions.  It
primarily documents user-visible (interface) changes, but also
includes internal changes of possible interest to the users.  When
describing new features, we try to also document ways of reverting to
the old behavior, where applicable.  If you dislike a recent change in
how SXEmacs behaves, this file might contain a remedy.

Use `C-c C-f' to move to the next equal level of outline, and
`C-c C-b' to move to previous equal level.  `C-h m' will give more
info about the Outline mode.  Many commands are also available through
the menubar.

Users who would like to know which capabilities have been introduced
in each release should look at the appropriate section of this file.



* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.14 (Geo)
==================================

We switched to git!  And this release cycle was all about updating the
build chain, version strings, and docs and whatnot from tla-isms to
git-isms. 

You can now grab the SXEmacs sources via git with...

   git clone http://git.sxemacs.org/sxemacs


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.12 (Fiat)
===================================

** Bugs closed in this release:

69, 86, 107, 109, 110, 111, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120

** Build chain fixes and updates -- Ferreira, Freundt, Youngs.

*** Fix building without eye-candy (*bars, widgets, etc)
*** Begin work on getting SXEmacs built on Arm Linux
*** Fix NetBSD 5 build
*** Mac OS build fixes

** Source tree reorganisation -- Ferreira.

Nelson put a lot of working into reorganising the SXEmacs source tree
hierarchy.  There are now several subdirectories under `src'...

	src/database -- has the database code
	src/ent      -- has the "Enhance Number Types" code
	src/events   -- has the "events" code
	src/media    -- has all the multimedia code
	src/mem      -- has memory related code
	src/mule     -- has the MULE stuff
	src/ui       -- has the UI code common to all toolkits
	src/ui/Gtk   -- has the old (non-working) GTK 1 code
	src/ui/TTY   -- has the TTY UI code
	src/ui/X11   -- has the X11 UI code
	src/ui/lwlib -- has the Lucid stuff

This was done with the view to making maintenance and debugging
easier, and also to simplify adding new features.

** FFI improvements, updates, and enhancements -- Zajcev


* SXEmacs 22.1.11 was never released.

See ChangeLog.d/ChangeLog-22.1.11 for all the changes in the
22.1.11 dev cycle, and for why it was not released.

* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.10 (Excalibur)
========================================

** Bugs closed in this release:

41, 65, 74, 75, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93,
94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104

** Cool New Sexy Stuff -- Zajcev, Ferreira, Freundt, Youngs.

Of course every release must have some cool new stuff.  Here's what's
new in this release...

*** User defined readers
*** It's possible to display video in a glyph object in a buffer.
*** SXEmacs is now a fairly decent image viewing/manipulation app.

There's an undo/redo stack, zoom in/out, rotate, chop/crop, red-eye
reduction.  There is a whole swag of transformations supported:
charcoal, contrast, despeckle, edge, enhance, equalise, gausian blur,
negate, normalise, oil painting, radial blur, 3D button effect,
sharpen, solarise, and swirl.

Who needs The Gimp when you have SXEmacs!

*** Added some MacOS icons.
*** Support for sqlite3 via FFI
*** New way for SXEmacs to handle different file types.

It allows you to have #'find-file take different actions based on a
predicate.  See the new variable `find-file-magic-files-alist'.

*** Enable PNG transparent backgrounds

Unfortunately this doesn't work if you use a background pixmap.

*** FFI callbacks implemented.
*** Dbus support via FFI (not completed)

This should be considered very much incomplete and experimental.  Only
rudimentary support is there so far.

** Build chain fixes/improvements -- Burkhardt, Ferreira, Freundt, Youngs.

Quite a few build chain related changes were made in this release,
including...

*** Work around a bug in GCC 4.5.0
*** Powerpc/BSD cpu detection
*** A Freedesktop.org compliant sxemacs.desktop file is now installed.
*** Updated FFmpeg detection.
*** OpenSSL 1.0.0 detection.  OpenSSL is no on by default.
*** Fix a link error when building with no MPQ
*** Fix a minor bison related issue (YYSTYPE)
*** Fix building with latest SoX
*** Fix --without-x builds
*** Fix many C compiler warnings and elisp byte-compiler warnings.
*** Fix install for non-FFI and non-Mule builds
*** Fix etags build for systems without getopt_long
*** Fix (hopefully) parallel builds
*** Fix BDWGC-enabled builds

** Minor updates to BDWGC code -- Freundt.

** Catch up with latest ffmpeg API changes -- Freundt.

** Fix for latest ediff -- Ferreira.

Changes emacs-internal to escape-quoted.

** Fix for subwindow resizing -- Zajcev.

** Various additions/updates to the contrib directory -- Ferreira

** FFI improvements -- Zajcev

** ENT fixes -- Freundt.

** TTY fixes -- Ferreira.

** Cleaner dump file (less pollution from the build/src dir) -- Freundt, Youngs.

** Improve #'file-basename -- Ferreira

It can now take a 2nd arg for extension stripping.

** Misc doc fixes/updates -- Burkhardt, Ferreira, Freundt, Zajcev, Youngs.

* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.9 (Edsel)
===================================

** Bugs closed in this release:

32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62

See http://issues.sxemacs.org/ for the details.

** Build chain fixes and improvements -- Freundt, Ferreira.

Better detection of ALSA, ffmpeg, libffi, libbind, and many other
various bits and pieces.

General build related fixes were made for MacOS, Solaris, HPUX, and of
course, Linux.

** New function, #'mapfam -- Freundt.

This new function is an extrememly powerful replacement for _all_ of
the current map functions.  It not only can do the job of the
existing map functions, but can also convert any sequence to any
other sequence.  Lots of other cool features as well, see its doc
string for full details.

** Init file migration code removed -- Youngs.

We feel that it is better to NOT mess with other emacsen's set ups.

** Compiler warning fixes -- Freundt.

** PNG images optimised for size -- Burkhardt.

All of the PNG images that we ship have been optimised for size.

** Re-work auto-autoloads loading a little -- Ferreira.

Priority is given to packages installed under ~/.sxemacs/ and care is
taken to eliminate those "foo-autoloads already loaded" warnings.

** Support 256 colour terminals -- Ferreira.

Support for 256 colour terminals and colour resolution through
approximation for tty devices.

** New FFI util, ffi-magic.el -- Youngs.

Uses libmagic to guess file type.

** Cool new stuff in the contrib directory -- Youngs, Ferreira.

There are tla hook scripts, build scripts, and build-report scripts.

** New garbage collector BDWGC -- Freundt.

SXEmacs can now use the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector.  It is
still experimental at this stage and there are known bugs (memory
leak).  If you have plenty of RAM it is quite usable, and noticably
faster than non-BDWGC SXEmacsen.  This new feature is not on by
default.  To get it, configure with --with-experimental-features=all.

** Support for BSD's MP removed -- Freundt.

** Emodule search path/loading fixes -- Youngs.

Emodule load path has been made sane.  #'load-module and
#'locate-module have both been vastly improved and both have
completion. 

** FFI improvements -- Youngs.

The FFI code has been improved so that it can be compatible with
XEmacs 21.5 for when they merge our FFI into their code base.  Also
#'ffi-load and #'ffi-load-library no longer need to be given a file
extension as part of the arg to allow for different platforms having
different shlib extensions.

Also, some UI enhancements were added to ffi-curl.el and
ffi-taglib.el.

** Etags improvements -- Youngs.

A bit of "UI" has been added to etags.el, as well as some code
optimising.

** Various minor tweaks, fixes, and documentation -- Burkhardt, Ferreira,
      Freundt, Wallington, Youngs.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.8 (Daimler)
=====================================

** Bugs closed in this release: 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31

You might notice a double up of bug numbers here from the previous
release.  The index got reset and so some bug ID numbers were
re-issued.

** Build chain fixes, improvements -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

We now have a libtool-based build chain.

** Minor improvements to packages bootstrapping -- Youngs.

** User's custom file renamed to custom-${USER}.el -- Youngs.

The old variant, custom.el is still used if that file exists.

** Sync XEmacs 21.5's cus-*.el, autoload.el, subr.el -- Youngs.

Amongst other things, this sync brings custom-defines, many new custom
widgets, and an implementation of the `:inherit' face keyword.

** Skiplist fixes -- Freundt.

** Introduce custom printers -- Zajcev.

** Update GPL licenced stuff to GPL version 3 -- Youngs.

** Add a rc.d inspired init mechanism -- Ferreira.

** Font lock improvements -- Ferreira.

** Byte compile defcustom init values, saving lisp values for correct editing -- Kehoe.

Sync from XEmacs 21.5.

** Improve interactivity of custom prompting -- Verna.

Sync from XEmacs 21.5.

** Resize echo area when needed -- Aichner, Turnbull, Youngs.

Sync from XEmacs 21.5.  Don't confuse this with rsz-minibuffer.el in
the packages,  This is different, the minibuffer and echo area are 2
different things.

** #'describe-function (C-h f) prints global keybindings for commands -- Kehoe, Youngs.

Sync from XEmacs 21.5.

** New `%b' spec for #'format -- Freundt, Kehoe.

This is for converting between ints and bit vectors.

** Sample init file updated -- Youngs.

** Fix the bug exposed by our weak-tests.el -- Youngs.

** Update the man page -- Youngs.

** Support character classes in regexps -- Freundt.

** Misc trivial changes such as doc fixes, typos, etc -- Burkhardt,
     Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.7 (De Lorean)
=======================================

** Bugs closed in this release: 13, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 31

** Much reworking of the build chain -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

Quite a bit has changed here, a few options have been changed, added,
or removed.  So if you haven't been following the development it might
pay you to have a look at our configure's --help output.

** Fix emodule loading on 64bit machines -- Freundt.

** Security fix in movemail.c (mktemp()->mkstemp()) -- Youngs.

** Etags synched up to upstream 17.32 -- Burkhardt, Youngs.

** Updates/fixes to dllists/skiplists -- Freundt, Ferreira.

** Lots of updates in the ENT area (Enhanced Number Types) -- Freundt.

Some stuff has been moved to an external emodule, "ASE" (Algebraic
Structures for ENT or "ASE Supersedes ENT").  Also directed graphs
have been introduced (sparse representation only so far).  And
introduce heaps (dense, dynamic, and week).

** cl.el meets C -- Freundt.

We've begun work on implementing the common lisp macros as an external
emodule.  The main focus here is speed, and initial benchmarks are
_very_ exciting... The emod version of #'dotimes (#'cl:dotimes) can be
nearly 200 times faster than its elisp counterpart!

This isn't finished yet, but watch future releases.

** package-suppress mechanism ported from XEmacs 21.5 -- Freundt, Youngs.

** Asynchronous version of #'curl:download added called #'curl:download& -- Freundt.

** Font-lock improvements, especially on TTYs -- Ferreira.

** Fix info search path -- Ferreira.

** Change default setting for progress guages to be off -- Youngs.

** Multimedia updates/fixes -- Freundt, Youngs.

Lots of reworking has been done here, especially with PulseAudio,
ffmpeg, and threading of the audio jobs etc.  Support for gstreamer
and xine has been dropped, and libmagic added.

** New macro to define "toggle" variables #'define-toggle-variable -- Zajcev

I wouldn't normally list a single new macro in this file, but this one
deserves a mention.  It sets up toggle variables, including
#'turn-on-VAR, #'turn-off-VAR, and #'toggle-VAR.  Very nifty.

** Many many compiler warnings have been fixed -- Freundt, Youngs.

Almost all byte-compiler warnings have been fixed in our build.  And a
good deal of the warnings in the C code of a standard build has been
fixed as well.

** GC fixes/updates -- Freundt.

** A contrib directory has been added to the tree -- Freundt.

So far there are patches in there to pop3.el, smtpmail.el, and
starttls.el which takes advantage of some of SXEmacs' cool native
features like OpenSSL.

Watch this space for more nifty things.

** Minor misc fixes (typos etc) -- Zajcev, Burkhardt, Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

** Documentation updates:
	o sppm.texi -- Burkhardt, Youngs.
	o lispref.texi -- Freundt, Youngs.
	o tips.texi -- Freundt.
	o building.texi -- Youngs.
	o processes.texi -- Ferreira.
	o internals.texi -- Freundt.

* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.6 (Cadillac)
======================================

** ENT (Enhanced Number Types) updates and fixes -- Freundt, Ferreira.

** MM (MultiMedia) updates and fixes -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

** FFi (Foreign Function Interface) updates -- Freundt, Zajcev.

** New ffi-gcrypt.el -- Freundt.

ffi-gcrypt.el brings GnuPG's libgcrypt bindings to SXEmacs.

** Line/column numbers in modeline are now padded -- Ferreira.

** New skiplists -- Freundt.

This is a basic implementation of Pugh's skip lists.  Their efficiency
is overwhelming when compared to alists or plists.  They also perform
better on insertion and removal than large hash-tables (due to the
resizing/rehashing which takes place).  They can be created almost as
fast as lisp lists and thus beat hash-tables there, too.

** Fix module (DSO) load paths -- Youngs.

** SXEmacs maintainer turned 40 -- Mr and Mrs Youngs.

This is a recurring bug that was first discovered on June 19th, 1966.

** Test suite updates/improvements -- Turnbull, Youngs.

** Etags updates/fixes -- Ferreira, Youngs.

Sync to Francesco's version 17.20 etags.  And major surgery on
etags.el to make it usable, fixing completion and support for the
"include" directive.

** Fix raw string parsing -- Kehoe.

A problem that arose in lisp-interaction-mode, where raw strings
were parsed as normal strings if you did a C-j after them, becase
forward-sexp couldn~t handle them.

** Sync bytecomp-runtime.el with XEmacs 21.5 -- Youngs.

The significance of this is that SXEmacs now has all those cool
with,if,when,and-boundp macros for clean byte-compiler warning
suppression.

** OpenSSL updates/fixes/improvements -- Freundt.

A rewrite of the old handshake functions.  SSL connections can be
established as before: open a network-stream, call ossl-ssl-handshake
on it and store the result.  The new implementation provides also
support for certificate authorities (CA), for peer certificates and,
using the network-server-streams, secure listening sockets.  This will
allow to connect/accept to/from servers/clients which require valid
peer certificates.

** New PulseAudio support -- Freundt.

PulseAudio is the successor to PolypAudio.  Because there were so few
users using Polyp (think we counted 2 and they're both SXEmacs
developers) SXEmacs support for PolypAudio was replaced by PulseAudio
support. 

** New Caching compiled regular expressions -- Freundt.

All you really need to do to use them is assign them (the regexp) to a
variable.  Here's an example...

  (let ((reg1 "^;+\\s-")
        (reg2 "\\s-+;+"))
    (while (and (re-search-forward reg1 nil t)
                (re-search-forward reg2 nil t))
      ...))

instead of:

  (while (and (re-search-forward "^;+\\s-" nil t)
              (re-search-forward "\\s-+;+" nil t))
    ...)

The former construct will store the compiled regular expressions in the
object property list of `reg1' and `reg2' on the first iteration of
`while', all following iterations will then use the already compiled
regexps.  The latter construct will behave as before, the regular
expression is compiled and stored, but since the string is hard-coded in
the buffer, it will be newly generated (with empty object-plist of
course) during every cycle of the while loop.

** Cleaner dump file -- Freundt, Youngs.

The portable dump file was getting polluted with things in the
packages load-path causing all sorts of undefined and unexpected
impossible to track down bugs.  No longer!

** Fix many many byte-compiler warnings in building core lisp -- Youngs.

** Fix building without emodules -- Ferreira.

** New Support emodules on MacOS -- Ferreira.

** Fix BerkeleyDB detection on NetBSD -- Ferreira.

** New SXEmacs icons added to dist -- Ferreira.

** Major restructuring of the build chain and install layout -- Freundt.

SXEmacs is now pretty much a completely autotool'd project... automake,
autoheader, the whole 9 yards.  And if that wasn't enough, we are now
also, to the best of our knowledge, reasonably FHS-compliant with our
install.

The changes to the install directory hierarchies are:

           now go to...                before went to...
  lisp     share/sxemacs-22.1.6/lisp/  lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/lisp/
  etc      share/sxemacs-22.1.6/etc/   lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/etc/
  info     share/info/                 lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/info/
  headers  include/sxemacs/22.1.6/     lib/sxemacs-22.1.6/<arch>/include/

Packages are now searched for in

  $prefix/share/sxemacs/{{s,}xemacs,mule,site}-packages/

instead of $prefix/lib/sxemacs/.../

** DnD dragged out and dropped on /dev/null -- Freundt.

** Misc build fixes -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

** Fix `tags' Makefile target -- Youngs.

** Fix bug in `lib-complete' -- Freundt.

The bug was causing `find-library' to visit the .elc instead of the
.el if you were running SXEmacs in-place from the build tree.

** Fix stack overflow crash in mapconcat -- Ferreira.

** Large update of about.el -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.

See: M-x about-sxemacs

** Various documentation updates/fixes/improvements -- Freundt, Ferreira, Youngs.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.5 (Bugatti)
=====================================
First up, this release has turned into a purely maintenance/bugfix
release.  SXEmacs 22.1.4 had several build-related issues that this
release addresses.

** version.sh fix -- Youngs.

Fix a problem with the wrong version being generated.

** Autoconf fixes -- Youngs, Ferreira, Freundt.

Lots of changes to the autoconf configure script

	- Recognise $CFLAGS environment variables
	- X toolkit autodetection redone
	- TTY autodetection fixed
	- PostgreSQL detection properly reported
	- Change allowed values for menubars, dialogs, widgets
		menubars -- no athena or motif
		dialogs  -- no lucid
		widgets  -- no lucid
	- Set configure's "bugreport address" to
	  http://issues.sxemacs.org. 
	- Fix gdbm/berkdb detection
	- Improve libc version detection

** New Makefile target (build-report) -- Kuehl.

`make build-report' is a convenience target.  It automatically
captures make output to files that `M-x build-rpt' knows about.  It
also runs `make check'.  The SXEmacs developers recommend that you use
this target to build SXEmacs.

** PROBLEMS updated -- Kuehl, Freundt.

Document SELinux/libffi issues and GMP/mpfr Fedora issues.

** pdump/ENT fix for *BSD -- Freundt.

** Documentation updates/fixes -- Youngs, Ferreira, Freundt.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.4 (Bentley Turbo)
===========================================

** Many more image formats via FFI/libWand -- Freundt.

FFI-enabled SXEmacs can load up libWand and thus display any image
format that libWand (ImageMagick) supports.

** Lots of updates to the ENT (Enhanced Number Types) code -- Freundt.

** Mule is on by default -- Youngs.

** Embeddable keyboard macros -- Kuehl.

This means that the following sort of thing is possible:

      C-x ( bar C-x )
      C-x ( foo C-x e C-x )
    
      C-x e
      => foo bar

** Default widgets/dialogs to Athena instead of Motif -- Youngs.

** OpenSSL updates -- Freundt.

Digest, encryption, and decryption routines that operate on files has
been added.  Previously this was only available for buffers.

** Build reports have been revamped -- Youngs, Freundt.

The SXEmacs build report no longer conflicts with the XEmacs
build-report.el.  Plus ours also reports on shared lib dependencies
and config.h stuff.  Sending from Gnus is also supported.

** FFI updates/fixes -- Youngs, Zajcev, Freundt.

** Ability to build postscript, pdf, and html docs -- Ferreira.

** Double linked lists and bloom filters implemented -- Freundt.

Bloom filters are a space and time-efficient way to decide about the
membership of an element to a given set. Using lisp-lists or vectors,
one usually has to traverse the entire list or vector, before
membership can be decided.  Using hash tables, membership decision is
in O(1) (bloom filters also decide in O(1)), but the hash-table's size
grows proportionally with the number n of elements, thus its space
complexity is O(n), whereas Bloom filters take a constant amount of
space regardless how many elements are in it.

** Lightning fast recursive version of directory-files -- Freundt.

It's called `directory-files-recur' and in some situations it is even
faster than GNU's find(1).

** Portuguese added to etc/HELLO -- Ferreira.

** Massive improvements, enhancements for multimedia (audio) -- Freundt.

SXEmacs supports several "sound servers" like: OSS, NAS, ESD, Polypaudio,
ALSA, aRts, and Jack.  And media streams can be handled by sndfile, ffmpeg,
sox, mad, xine, gstreamer.  The SXEmacs developers recommend Polyp/ffmpeg
whenever possible.

And yes, SXEmacs _can_ play mp3 files. :-)

** Autoconf fixes/updates -- Youngs, Freundt.

All of the enable/disable options have been converted to with/without
options.  This allows us to sort them into groups.

Also fixes were made to allow building on FreeBSD and NetBSD.

** Big update for the FAQ -- Youngs, Freundt.

** Server Sockets! -- Ferreira.

SXEmacs now has server sockets (Yay!).  See
`open-network-server-stream'.

** Compiler fixes (gcc 2.95) -- Freundt.

** bug-reporter update -- Youngs.

`report-sxemacs-bug' now directs people to our BugZilla installation
at http://issues.sxemacs.org/

** Documentation updates/fixes/improvements -- Youngs, Ferreira, Freundt.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.3 (BMW)
=================================

** OpenSSL updates, improvements, and fixes -- Freundt.

** FFI updates, and fixes -- Zajcev.

FFI now defaults to "on" if libffi can be found at configure time.  It
you don't want this, use: `--disable-ffi'.

FTP downloads with `curl:download' is working properly now.  And with
HTTP transfers you can transfer just the HTTP header for a file if you
wish.

** Extent/glyph fixes -- Sidwell, Kuehl.

** 32 mouse buttons supported -- Youngs.

(global-set-key [(button32)] 'some-function) is valid in SXEmacs.

** Modeline tweaks -- Ferreira.

Move line/column number indicators to left side (aka XE 21.5)

** M-x uptime -- Youngs.

Every good OS has an uptime util, SXEmacs is no exception.  Reports
uptime in various formats.

** ia64 build fixes -- Lesjak.

** `C-h n' will no longer find NEWS files from packages -- Youngs.

** List of package mirrors updated -- Aichner, Skyttä.

** Bootstrappable PUI -- Youngs.

SXEmacs no longer needs to have _any_ packages pre-installed before
PUI can be used.  See (Info-goto-node "(sxemacs)Bootstrapping PUI").

** Bignums, and a whole swag of sexy new number goodness -- Freundt.

Bignums, bigfloats, and ratios that you may know from XEmacs 21.5 are
now in SXEmacs.  That and a whole lot more...

Features provided when all of the library demands are met:
    
  (featurep 'bigz) and 
  (featurep 'bignum)       <=> if MPZ from GMP or BSD MP is present
  
  (featurep 'bigq) and
  (featurep 'ratio)        <=> if MPQ from GMP is present
  
  (featurep 'bigf) and
  (featurep 'bigfloat)     <=> if MPF from GMP is present
  
  (featurep 'bigfr)        <=> if MPFR is present
  
  (featurep 'bigc)         <=> if MPC is present
  
  (featurep 'number-types) <=> if one of the above features is
  provided

For complete details see: (Info-goto-node "(lispref)Enhanced Number Types")

** Raw strings -- Kuehl.

SXEmacs tries to relieve backslashitis by implementing raw strings.
You'll imediately notice the benefit of raw strings when use them for
those hairy regexps.  Consider the regular expression (from
font-latex.el)... 

  "\\(?:^\\|[^\\]\\)\\(?:\\\\\\\\\\)*\\(\\\\[@A-Za-z]+\\)"

As a raw string it could be written as...

  #r"\(?:^\|[^\]\)\(?:\)*\(\\[@A-Za-z]+\)"

Most of the SXEmacs core lisp code has been converted over to using
raw strings whereever appropriate.

** Improved font-locking in a TTY -- Ferreira.

To illustrate this...

  $ sxemacs -nw -vanilla

...and look at the modeline.  Now open a .c file and turn on
font-lock... 

  C-x C-f /path/to/file.c RET
  M-x font-lock-mode RET

** Compiler fixes -- Zajcev.

** SXEmacs can no longer be built with a C++ compiler -- Youngs.

To build SXEmacs you will need a C compiler at least the equivalent of
GCC 2.95.3.  Building with a C++ compiler is no longer supported.

** Autoconf fixes, updates -- Freundt, Kuehl, Youngs.

All autoconf options now have a help string (for ./configure --help)
and the default setting for each option is noted.

** PostgreSQL auto-detection improved -- Youngs.

If pg_config is in your $PATH, SXEmacs will add PostgreSQL support at
configure/build time.

** Documentation (Texinfo) updates -- Freundt, Youngs.

The SXEmacs manual is now called "sxemacs" instead of "xemacs".  C-h
C-i sxemacs RET to read it.

Most of the Texinfo docs now have been updated to say "SXEmacs"
whereever appropriate instead of "XEmacs".

** GTK (version 1.2) build fixes -- Youngs.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.2 (Audi)
==================================

** autoconf 2.59 compatible configure scripts -- Youngs, Purvis.

Many configure options have changed.  Please run `./configure --help'
to see what the new options are.

** Most win32 code is now gone -- Youngs, Freundt.

** `describe-installation' report libc version on Slackware -- Youngs.

** etags.c updated to Francesco's version 17.11 -- Youngs.

** Support `ls --dired' properly -- Sperber.

** FFI (Foreign Function Interface) updates -- Zajcev.

One of the most exciting things is that this version of SXEmacs can
download files from the internet _without_ the need of any XEmacs
packages being installed.  If you have libcurl and enable FFI in
SXEmacs at build time, you can:

	(require 'ffi-curl)
	(curl:download "http://www.somedomain.com/path/file"
	               "/tmp/file")

To put your mind at ease, libcurl is _NOT_ needed to build SXEmacs.
The above will work even if you install libcurl after
building/installing SXEmacs.

** Don't echo GC messages for non-string GC'ing -- Zajcev.

This drastically reduces the number of "Garbage Collecting" messages
that you see in the echo area.  Garbage collection is still happening,
it is just not in your face as much.

** movemail.c security fixes -- Oskarsson.

** PUI's *packages* buffer enhancements -- Koch.

** Saner fallbacks for `backup-buffer' -- Youngs.

Based on an idea from JWZ, if the backup can't be written, try in
`auto-save-directory', and if that fails, fall back to $HOME.

** OpenSSL support -- Freundt.

Of course. The OpenSSL library itself is actually separated into two
libraries: libcrypto and libssl.  libcrypto is the part which comes to
elisp with the current API.  libssl is planned for the near future.

With this interface/gateway we now have access to the wonderful world
of static cryptography (static here means no handshake/protocols/etc.).

The API contains:

- the OpenSSL PRNG = (pseudo) random number generator to provide
  generating cryptographically secure randomness

- the OpenSSL MDs (message digests) to provide all sorts of hashing
  (we had an md5 implementation already)

- the HMAC aka keyed hashing aka message authentication code to provide
  hashes secured by a password

- the CIPHER engine (i.e. symmetric crypto systems) to provide
  encryption/decryption routines secured by a password

- the PKEY engine (i.e. asymmetric crypto systems) to provide generation
  and distribution of private/public key pairs (as probably known by
  gpg)

- the HYBRIDe engine aka PKCS aka public key crypto systems to provide
  encryption based on (foreign) public keys and decryption with own
  private keys to provide also digital signatures and verification (as
  probably known by gpg)

** Remove most of the generated files from the repo -- Youngs, Freundt.

** Allow suppression of WM decorations -- Turnbull.

This makes balloon-help windows infinitely better behaved.  Thank you
very much, Steve T.

** Fontify *scratch* buffer according to user's settings -- Kehoe.

** Fix bug hanging SXEmacs when yanking > 260kb -- Kehoe.

** lispref manual updated for SXEmacs -- Freundt.

** PostgreSQL updates (mainly doc updates) -- Frenudt.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.1 (Aston Martin)
==========================================

** user-init-directory set to ~/.sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old ~/.xemacs directory is enough to get up
and running with SXEmacs.

** Packages hierarchy default set to $prefix/lib/sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old $prefix/lib/xemacs directory is enough to
get up and running with SXEmacs.  SXEmacs will do this for you when
you do `make install'.

** Rename items in the menubar -- Slusar, Youngs.

** Beginnings of FFI -- Zajcev.

FFI is "Foreign Function Interface" and will allow access to functions
and libraries outside of SXEmacs from within lisp.  Not completed yet,
but the basic infrastructure is in place.

** FreeBSD build fixes -- Slusar.

** M-x report-sxemacs-bug -- Youngs.

For now, this is just a wrapper around report-xemacs-bug with the
appropriate variables set to SXEmacs values.

** Fix etags.c -- Slusar.

Avoid a segv.

** M-x build-report -- Youngs.

Make it work for SXEmacs.

** Fix major bug in regex.c

This fixed a whole swag of crashes involving regexps and
syntax-tables. 

** Sync up with XEmacs 21.4 -- Various Developers.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.0 (Alfa Romeo)
========================================

This is the first release of SXEmacs.  It is a fork of XEmacs
21.4.16.  The vast majority of the changes between SXEmacs 22.1.0 and
the code it descended from, XEmacs 21.4.16, are purely renaming
"XEmacs" to "SXEmacs".
