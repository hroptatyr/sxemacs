* Introduction
==============

This file presents the changes in recent SXEmacs versions.  It
primarily documents user-visible (interface) changes, but also
includes internal changes of possible interest to the users.  When
describing new features, we try to also document ways of reverting to
the old behavior, where applicable.  If you dislike a recent change in
how SXEmacs behaves, this file might contain a remedy.

Use `C-c C-f' to move to the next equal level of outline, and
`C-c C-b' to move to previous equal level.  `C-h m' will give more
info about the Outline mode.  Many commands are also available through
the menubar.

Users who would like to know which capabilities have been introduced
in each release should look at the appropriate section of this file.



* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.1 (Aston Martin)
==========================================

** user-init-directory set to ~/.sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old ~/.xemacs directory is enough to get up
and running with SXEmacs.

** Packages hierarchy default set to $prefix/lib/sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old $prefix/lib/xemacs directory is enough to
get up and running with SXEmacs.  SXEmacs will do this for you when
you do `make install'.

** Rename items in the menubar -- Sluser, Youngs.

** Beginnings of FFI -- Zajcev.

FFI is "Foreign Function Interface" and will allow access to functions
and libraries outside of SXEmacs from within lisp.  Not completed yet,
but the basic infrastructure is in place.

** FreeBSD build fixes -- Sluser.

** M-x report-sxemacs-bug -- Youngs.

For now, this is just a wrapper around report-xemacs-bug with the
appropriate variables set to SXEmacs values.

** Fix etags.c -- Sluser.

Avoid a segv.

** M-x build-report -- Youngs.

Make it work for SXEmacs.

** Fix major bug in regex.c

This fixed a whole swag of crashes involving regexps and
syntax-tables. 

** Sync up with XEmacs 21.4 -- Various Developers.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.0 (Alfa Romeo)
========================================

This is the first release of SXEmacs.  It is a fork of XEmacs
21.4.16.  The vast majority of the changes between SXEmacs 22.1.0 and
the code it descended from, XEmacs 21.4.16, are purely renaming
"XEmacs" to "SXEmacs".
