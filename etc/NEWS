* Introduction
==============

This file presents the changes in recent SXEmacs versions.  It
primarily documents user-visible (interface) changes, but also
includes internal changes of possible interest to the users.  When
describing new features, we try to also document ways of reverting to
the old behavior, where applicable.  If you dislike a recent change in
how SXEmacs behaves, this file might contain a remedy.

Use `C-c C-f' to move to the next equal level of outline, and
`C-c C-b' to move to previous equal level.  `C-h m' will give more
info about the Outline mode.  Many commands are also available through
the menubar.

Users who would like to know which capabilities have been introduced
in each release should look at the appropriate section of this file.



* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.0
===========================

This is the first release of SXEmacs.  It is a fork of XEmacs
21.4.16.  The vast majority of the changes between SXEmacs 22.1.0 and
the code it descended from, XEmacs 21.4.16, are purely renaming
"XEmacs" to "SXEmacs".
