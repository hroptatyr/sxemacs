* Introduction
==============

This file presents the changes in recent SXEmacs versions.  It
primarily documents user-visible (interface) changes, but also
includes internal changes of possible interest to the users.  When
describing new features, we try to also document ways of reverting to
the old behavior, where applicable.  If you dislike a recent change in
how SXEmacs behaves, this file might contain a remedy.

Use `C-c C-f' to move to the next equal level of outline, and
`C-c C-b' to move to previous equal level.  `C-h m' will give more
info about the Outline mode.  Many commands are also available through
the menubar.

Users who would like to know which capabilities have been introduced
in each release should look at the appropriate section of this file.



* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.2 (Audi)
==================================

** autoconf 2.59 compatible configure scripts -- Youngs, Purvis.

Many configure options have changed.  Please run `./configure --help'
to see what the new options are.

** Most win32 code is now gone -- Youngs, Freundt.

** `describe-installation' report libc version on Slackware -- Youngs.

** etags.c updated to Francesco's version 17.11 -- Youngs.

** Support `ls --dired' properly -- Sperber.

** FFI (Foreign Function Interface) updates -- Zajcev.

One of the most exciting things is that this version of SXEmacs can
download files from the internet _without_ the need of any XEmacs
packages being installed.  If you have libcurl and enable FFI in
SXEmacs at build time, you can:

	(require 'ffi-curl)
	(curl:download "http://www.somedomain.com/path/file"
	               "/tmp/file")

To put your mind at ease, libcurl is _NOT_ needed to build SXEmacs.
The above will work even if you install libcurl after
building/installing SXEmacs.

** Don't echo GC messages for non-string GC'ing -- Zajcev.

This drastically reduces the number of "Garbage Collecting" messages
that you see in the echo area.  Garbage collection is still happening,
it is just not in your face as much.

** movemail.c security fixes -- Oskarsson.

** PUI's *packages* buffer enhancements -- Koch.

** Saner fallbacks for `backup-buffer' -- Youngs.

Based on an idea from JWZ, if the backup can't be written, try in
`auto-save-directory', and if that fails, fall back to $HOME.

** OpenSSL support -- Freundt.

Of course. The OpenSSL library itself is actually separated into two
libraries: libcrypto and libssl.  libcrypto is the part which comes to
elisp with the current API.  libssl is planned for the near future.

With this interface/gateway we now have access to the wonderful world
of static cryptography (static here means no handshake/protocols/etc.).

The API contains:

- the OpenSSL PRNG = (pseudo) random number generator to provide
  generating cryptographically secure randomness

- the OpenSSL MDs (message digests) to provide all sorts of hashing
  (we had an md5 implementation already)

- the HMAC aka keyed hashing aka message authentication code to provide
  hashes secured by a password

- the CIPHER engine (i.e. symmetric crypto systems) to provide
  encryption/decryption routines secured by a password

- the PKEY engine (i.e. asymmetric crypto systems) to provide generation
  and distribution of private/public key pairs (as probably known by
  gpg)

- the HYBRIDe engine aka PKCS aka public key crypto systems to provide
  encryption based on (foreign) public keys and decryption with own
  private keys to provide also digital signatures and verification (as
  probably known by gpg)

** Remove most of the generated files from the repo -- Youngs, Freundt.

** Allow suppression of WM decorations -- Turnbull.

This makes balloon-help windows infinitely better behaved.  Thank you
very much, Steve T.

** Fontify *scratch* buffer according to user's settings -- Kehoe.

** Fix bug hanging SXEmacs when yanking > 260kb -- Kehoe.

** lispref manual updated for SXEmacs -- Freundt.

** PostgreSQL updates (mainly doc updates) -- Frenudt.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.1 (Aston Martin)
==========================================

** user-init-directory set to ~/.sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old ~/.xemacs directory is enough to get up
and running with SXEmacs.

** Packages hierarchy default set to $prefix/lib/sxemacs -- Youngs.

Symlinking this to your old $prefix/lib/xemacs directory is enough to
get up and running with SXEmacs.  SXEmacs will do this for you when
you do `make install'.

** Rename items in the menubar -- Slusar, Youngs.

** Beginnings of FFI -- Zajcev.

FFI is "Foreign Function Interface" and will allow access to functions
and libraries outside of SXEmacs from within lisp.  Not completed yet,
but the basic infrastructure is in place.

** FreeBSD build fixes -- Slusar.

** M-x report-sxemacs-bug -- Youngs.

For now, this is just a wrapper around report-xemacs-bug with the
appropriate variables set to SXEmacs values.

** Fix etags.c -- Slusar.

Avoid a segv.

** M-x build-report -- Youngs.

Make it work for SXEmacs.

** Fix major bug in regex.c

This fixed a whole swag of crashes involving regexps and
syntax-tables. 

** Sync up with XEmacs 21.4 -- Various Developers.


* Changes in SXEmacs 22.1.0 (Alfa Romeo)
========================================

This is the first release of SXEmacs.  It is a fork of XEmacs
21.4.16.  The vast majority of the changes between SXEmacs 22.1.0 and
the code it descended from, XEmacs 21.4.16, are purely renaming
"XEmacs" to "SXEmacs".
