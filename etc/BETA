* Introduction
==============

You are running a potentially unstable version of SXEmacs.  Please do
not report problems with Beta SXEmacs to comp.emacs.xemacs.  Report
them to <sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org>, preferably with 
'M-x report-sxemacs-bug RET'. 

** Mailing Lists
================

*** SXEmacs Devel Mailing List <sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org>
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are not subscribed to the SXEmacs Devel list you should be.
Currently all discussion of development issues, including bug reports
and coding discussion, takes place on the SXEmacs Devel mailing list.
Only patches and administrative actions regarding patches are sent
elsewhere (to the SXEmacs Patches list).

*** SXEmacs Patches Mailing List <sxemacs-patches@sxemacs.org>
--------------------------------------------------------------

SXEmacs Patches records proposed changes to SXEmacs, and their
disposition.  It is open subscription, and all patches that are
seriously proposed for inclusion in SXEmacs should be posted here.  You
can follow progress of your patch by subscribing to the mailing list
or in the archives.  You will be notified of the outcome of your
patch, whether it will be merged into the main code base or rejected.
If the latter, an explanation will be given also.

*** SXEmacs Builds Mailing List <sxemacs-builds@sxemacs.org>
------------------------------------------------------------

The SXEmacs Builds list is where build reports (M-x build-rpt) are
sent.  Discussion, although not banned, is encouraged to occur on the
devel list.

*** List Administrivia
----------------------

In the descriptions below, the word LIST (all uppercase) is a
variable.  Substitute "devel", "patches", or "builds" as appropriate.

The SXEmacs mailing lists are managed by the Mailman mailing list
package, and the usual Mailman commands work.  Do not send mailing
list requests to the main address (<sxemacs-LIST@sxemacs.org>), always
send them to <sxemacs-LIST-request@sxemacs.org>.  If you have problems
with the list itself, they should be brought to the attention of the
SXEmacs Mailing List Owner <sxemacs-LIST-owner@sxemacs.org>.  All
public mailing lists are archived.  The URL is

	     http://www.sxemacs.org/list-archives/html/sxemacs-LIST

Note that the sxemacs-LIST-admin address is used internally by the
Mailman software; it is NOT a synonym for sxemacs-LIST-request.

*** Managing your subscription via the Web
------------------------------------------

Subscription, unsubscription, and options (such as digests and
temporarily suspending delivery) can be accomplished via the web
interface at <http://www.sxemacs.org/mailman/listinfo/sxemacs-LIST>.

*** Subscribing by e-mail
-------------------------

Send an email message to <sxemacs-LIST-request@sxemacs.org> with
`subscribe' (without the quotes) as the BODY of the message.

*** Unsubscribing by e-mail
---------------------------

Send an email message to <sxemacs-LIST-request@sxemacs.org> with
`unsubscribe' (without the quotes) as the BODY of the message.

** Beta Release Schedule
========================

To be done.

** Reporting Problems
=====================

The best way to get problems fixed in SXEmacs is to submit good problem
reports, 'M-x report-sxemacs-bug RET' will help you do this (assuming
you have a usable SXEmacs).  Since this is beta software, problems are
certain to exist.  Please read through all of part II of the SXEmacs
FAQ for an overview of problem reporting.  Other items which are most
important are:

1.  Do not submit C stack backtraces without line numbers.  Since it
    is possible to compile optimized with debug information with GCC
    it is never a good idea to compile SXEmacs without the -g flag.
    SXEmacs runs on a variety of platforms, and often it is not
    possible to recreate problems which afflict a specific platform.
    The line numbers in the C stack backtrace help isolate where the
    problem is actually occurring.
 
2.  Attempt to recreate the problem starting with an invocation of
    SXEmacs with `sxemacs -no-autoloads'.  Quite often, problems are
    due to package interdependencies, and the like.  An actual bug
    in SXEmacs should be reproducible in a default configuration
    without loading any special packages (or the one or two specific
    packages that cause the bug to appear).  If you have trouble
    getting anything to work at all with the above invocation, use
    `sxemacs -vanilla' instead.  If you need to load your user init
    file or the site file to get the problem to occur, then it has
    something to do with them, and you should try to isolate the
    issue in those files.

3.  A picture can be worth a thousand words.  When reporting an unusual
    display, it is generally best to capture the problem in a screen
    dump and include that with the problem report.  The easiest way to
    get a screen dump is to use the xv program and its grab function.
    MIME is the preferred method for making the image attachments.

** Getting the Source
=====================

See the file DISTRIB in this directory.  Or, inside SXEmacs, do `C-h
C-d'. 

* Compiling Beta SXEmacs
========================

SXEmacs can be built inside or outside the source tree.  The thing to
remember if you are building outside the source tree is that if
configure is further away than ../ you'll have to use the
`--srcdir=DIR' option.

Some of the maintainers build in a subdirectory of the top level
source tree.  Usually naming their build directory something like
`=build'.  The `=' prefix will allow the directory to not get in the
way of the version control system (GNU/arch (tla)).

cd to the top level of your build tree and run the autogen.sh script
found in the top level source tree:

  ../autogen.sh

This will generate, among other things, the Makefile.in files and the
configure script. (note that you can omit this step if you are
building from a tarball release)


Next, issue an appropriate configure command.  One developer uses the
following at the time of this writing:

  ../configure \
	--with-clash-detection              \
	--with-ent=all                      \
	--with-openssl                      \
	--with-scrollbars=athena            \
	--with-xfs                          \
	--with-site-prefixes=/usr/local/ssl \
	--with-athena=next                  \
	--without-dlmalloc

Part of the configure output is a summary that looks something
like the following.  (this summary is also available as the file
'Installation' in the top directory of your build tree, and via
the command 'M-x describe-installation RET').

uname -a: Linux bastard 2.6.19 #6 PREEMPT Fri Dec 1 14:14:49 EST 2006 i686 AuthenticAMD AMD Athlon(TM) XP 2600+ GNU/Linux

No bogus options. Have a nice build :)


Then...

$ make build-report

...and you should have a working SXEmacs.  You may install via the
normal `make install'.

Note to distro packagers:  This release of SXEmacs supports the
DESTDIR Makefile variable for installing to a packaging tmp root.

After you have verified that you have a functional editor, fire up
your favorite mail program and send a build report to
<sxemacs-builds@sxemacs.org>.

Preferably this is best done from SXEmacs, following these simple steps:

M-x customize-group RET build-rpt RET
M-x build-rpt RET


* Packages
==========

[Note: these instructions have been partly updated, but not carefully
reviewed in some time.  Caveat tester.]

Starting with XEmacs 21.1, much of the functionality of XEmacs has
been unbundled into "the packages."  For more information about the
package system, see the Info nodes on Packages (in the XEmacs User
Manual) and on Packaging (in the Lisp Reference).

When bootstrapping SXEmacs, you may need to manually install some
packages (at least sxemacs-base and efs).  These packages are available
by FTP at <ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/>.

** Binary package installation
==============================

Prerequisite:  XEmacs 21.0-b1.

Binary packages are complete entities that can be untarred at the top
level of an XEmacs package hierarchy and work at runtime.  To install files
in this directory, run the command `M-x package-admin-add-binary-package'
and fill in appropriate values to the prompts.

** Manual procedures for package management
===========================================

Prerequisite: XEmacs 21.0

When adding and deleting files from a lisp directory the
auto-autoloads.el (global symbols) and custom-load.el (Customization
groups) must be kept in synch.  Assuming one is manipulating a
directory called `lisp-utils', the command to rebuild the
auto-autoloads.el file is:

sxemacs -vanilla -batch \
  -eval \("setq autoload-package-name \"lisp-utils\""\) \
  -f batch-update-directory lisp-utils

The command to rebuild the custom-load.el file is:

sxemacs -vanilla -batch -f Custom-make-dependencies lisp-utils

To byte-compile both of these files the command is:

sxemacs -vanilla -batch -f batch-byte-compile \
	lisp-utils/auto-autoloads.el lisp-utils/custom-load.el

Of course, being a beta tester, you'd be aware that it is much easier
to manage your SXEmacs packages with PUI.

** Building SXEmacs and XEmacs packages from scratch
====================================================

To build everything completely from scratch isn't hard, just time
consuming. 

*** Step 1 - grab the sources (core and packages)

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.xemacs.org:/pack/xemacscvs login
 [password: "cvs" (sans quotes)]

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.xemacs.org:/pack/xemacscvs co packages

That gets you all the XEmacs packages.

$ tla register-archive http://arch.sxemacs.org/2006

$ tla get steve@sxemacs.org--2006/sxemacs--main--22.1.6 sxemacs

That puts a copy of the latest SXEmacs sources into $PWD/sxemacs/

*** Step 2 - build SXEmacs

$ cd sxemacs
$ ./autogen.sh  (not necessary for tarball releases)
$ ./configure [options...]
$ make

(use `make build-report' if you are planning to send in a build report
via `M-x build-rpt')

And optionally:

$ make install 2>&1 | tee ,,make-install.out


*** Step 3 - build and install the packages

$ cd packages
$ cp Local.rules.template Local.rules

Then edit Local.rules to suit your needs/environment
see: (Info-goto-node "(sxemacs)Local.rules file") for details about
this file.

You'll most likely want to make the following changes to Local.rules:

  XEMACS_BINARY = sxemacs
  XEMACS_INSTALLED_PACKAGES_ROOT = /usr/local/share/sxemacs
  BATCH = $(VANILLA) -batch -eval '(setq stack-trace-on-error t)' -l build-rpt

And then:

$ make install

* Improving SXEmacs
===================

** Creating patches for submission
==================================

First, go read...

  (Info-goto-node "(sppm)Patches")

All patches to SXEmacs that are seriously proposed for inclusion (eg,
bug fixes) should be mailed to <sxemacs-patches@sxemacs.org>.  Each
patch will be reviewed by the SXEmacs team, and will be acknowledged and
added to the distribution, or rejected with an explanation.  Progress of
the patch is tracked on the SXEmacs Patches mailing list, which is open
subscription.  If a patch is simply intended to facilitate discussion,
send it to the SXEmacs Devel <sxemacs-devel@sxemacs.org> list instead, a
Cc to SXEmacs Patches is optional, but doesn't hurt.

The best way to go about getting your patches included into the
SXEmacs code base is to create your own GNU/arch branch of SXEmacs and
send your commit logs/merge requests to sxemacs-patches@sxemacs.org.
This can easily be set up via tla hooks.

The rest of this section applies to the XEmacs packages.

Patches to XEmacs Lisp packages should be sent to the maintainer of
the package.  If the maintainer is listed as `XEmacs Development Team'
patches should be sent to <xemacs-patches@xemacs.org>.

The command...

  C-u M-x package-get-info RET PKG_NAME RET maintainer RET

...will put the PKG_NAME's package maintainer's name and email address
at point in the current buffer.

Emailed patches should preferably be sent in MIME format and quoted
printable encoding (if necessary).

The simplest way to create well-formed patches is to use CVS and
Didier Verna's Patcher library (available as patcher.el in the
xemacs-devel package).  Patcher is new and requires some setup, but
most of the core developers are now using it for their own patches.
Patcher also can be configured to create patches for several projects,
and recognize the project from the directory it is invoked in.  This
makes it a useful general tool (as long as XEmacs-style patches are
accepted at your other projects, which is likely since they conform to
the GNU standards).

When making patches by hand, please use the `-u' option.  Using
ordinary (context-free) diffs are notoriously prone to error, since
line numbers tend to change when others make changes to the same
source file.

An example of the `diff' usage:

$ diff -u OLDFILE NEWFILE

Each patch should be accompanied by an update to the appropriate
ChangeLog file.  Guidelines for writing ChangeLog entries is governed
by the GNU coding standards.  Please see
<http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html>   [Change Logs section]
for details.

Do not submit context diffs (either -c or -u) of ChangeLogs.  Because
of the "stack" nature of ChangeLogs (new entries are always pushed on
the top), context diffs will fail to apply more often than they
succeed.  Simply cutting and pasting the entry from an Emacs buffer to
the mail buffer (beware of tab expansion!) is probably easiest.  The
Patcher library also will set up your ChangeLogs for you, and copy
them to the mail.  Context-less unified diffs (-U 0) are also
acceptable.

*** Patch discussion etiquette
-------------------------------

If you intend a patch for _application_ to the sources as is, _always_
post it to sxemacs-patches, even if there are minor points you would
like to have discussed by others.  Not doing so will resulting in
patches getting "lost".  If you expect that the patch will not be
acceptable, but are using it to stimulate discussion, then don't post
to sxemacs-patches.  Intermediate cases are up to your judgment;
unless you're sure you'll follow up with a "real" patch, better to err
on the side of posting to sxemacs-patches.

** Large contributions
======================

Perhaps you have a whole new mode, or a major synchronization with
upstream for a neglected package, or a synchronization with GNU Emacs
you would like to contribute.  We welcome such contributions, but they
are likely to be relatively controversial, generate more comments and
requests for revision, and take longer to integrate.  Please be
patient with the process.

*** Syncing with GNU Emacs and/or XEmacs
----------------------------------------

Syncing with GNU Emacs and XEmacs is an important activity.  Although
each version has its advantages and areas of concentration, it is very
desirable that common functionality share specifications and APIs.
When porting GNU code to SXEmacs, the following points should be given
special attention:

  o Recent GNU Emacsen cannot be built without Mule, but SXEmacs can.
    Make sure your changes do not assume the presence of Mule.

  o GNU Emacs nomenclature often differs from that of SXEmacs.
    Sometimes syncing the names is desirable, other times not.

  o GNU Emacs functionality often differs from that of SXEmacs.
    Syncing functionality is often controversial.

It is important that you let other developers know that
synchronization has taken place, to what degree, and when.  For this
purpose, we use comments of the form

/* Synched up with: FSF 21.3 by Steve Youngs */

/* Synched up with: XEmacs 21.4.15 by Steve Youngs */

in the source file itself, as the last element of the prefatory
material (copyright notice and commentary).  Obviously the comment
marker needs to be changed to leading semicolons for Lisp, but
otherwise the format is the same.

Rather than dates we use the version of GNU Emacs to sync to.  If the
synchronization is partial, add a new comment describing what has
actually been synched, leaving the description of the last full sync
in place.  At each full sync, remove all previous synchronization
comments.

This applies to Lisp that we have broken out into packages, but
remains in the GNU Emacs core, as well to core Lisp in XEmacs.
