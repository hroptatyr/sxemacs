GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other technical information you
supply anyone in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU
software.  This includes any information specifically designed to
ameliorate the use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:

Allegro Consultants, Inc, in association with DIS International, is
now offering annual support contracts covering the GNU Compiler
Collection and related tools, including the GCC C and C++ compilers
for MPE/iX.

The free GCC C and C++ compilers have been available on MPE/iX for
several years now, and are used for mission-critical applications by
many organizations including Hewlett-Packard. Until now, assistance
was available only from Mark Klein of DIS on a limited, voluntary
basis. Mark is the person who originally ported GCC to the HP e3000,
and he continues to maintain the software and port new versions.

Support contracts start at $1,995.00/year for an organization
(unlimited number of HP e3000 computer systems) with two designated
callers.  Additional options are available for large organizations who
need to designate more than two authorized callers, or who want the
additional security of 24x7 coverage.

e-mail:   <levitte@lp.se>

What I do:
	I work with various free software packages, mostly GNU ones,
	for Unix and VMS (the latter both on VAX and Alpha).  I've
        been porting GNU Emacs to VMS between spring 1991 and
	somewhere in 1998.  I've  ported a bunch of other GNU programs
	as well.  I maintain GNU vmslib.
        For further info, see http://www.lp.se/~levitte/prof/resume.html

Programs supported:
        To a varying degree (ranging from extension and porting to
        installation and simple questions) at the time of updating
        this entry:
        - GNU vmslib, emacs, autoconf, zip, diffutils, m4, patch,
          texinfo, C/C++; on both VMS and Unix.
        - Other GNU programs to a small degree; on Unix.
        For further info, look at http://www.lp.se/products/gnu.html

Experience:
        Fluent in TeX/LaTeX and many programming languages.
        Modified key elements in Emacs (e.g., memory and process
        management) to work transparently on VMS.  I have very good
        knowledge in the VMS operating system.  I'm also knowledged in
        the a few Unix flavors.
	Well knowledged in cryptography as well as the development of
        the PKIX standards (both based on X.500 and RFC 2459) and
        involved protocols (SSL, OCSP, CMS, ...)

The Written Word provides CDs of pre-compiled Open Source applications
on popular UNIX variants.  Clients can purchase a one-time CD set
($149/set), or a subscription, which provides four quarterly releases.
Two types of subscription are available: "media only" ($550/year), or
"media and updates" ($1459/year).  The "media and updates"
subscription entitles the subscriber, via a web site, to patches,
security fixes, new releases to existing packages, new packages,
online documentation, and changelog information, between releases, and
a central bug tracking system for all packages.
