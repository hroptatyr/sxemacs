This is a list of the status of XEmacs on various machines and systems.
See PROBLEMS for particular problems and possible workarounds.

Much effort has gone into making XEmacs work on as many different
machines, configurations, and compilers as possible.

Much effort has gone into making XEmacs 64-bit clean.

Much effort has gone into removing system-specific code, and replacing
such code with autodetection at configure time.

The XEmacs core should build "out of the box" on most Unix-like systems.

XEmacs 21.2 (the development branch that is the base for the 21.4
release series) was tested and `make check' succeeded on these Unix
configurations as of 2001-02-10:

alphaev56-dec-osf4.0e (both Compaq C and gcc)
i386-unknown-freebsd4.2
i386-unknown-netbsdelf1.5
i586-sco-sysv5uw7.0.1 (both SCO's cc and gcc)
i686-pc-linux-gnu
hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20 (both HP's ANSI cc and gcc)
mips-sgi-irix6.5 (both MIPSpro cc and gcc)
rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.0.0 (both IBM's xlc and gcc)
sparc-sun-solaris2.6 (both Sun's Forte C and gcc)
sparc-sun-solaris2.7 (both Sun's Forte C and gcc)
sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4 (gcc)

Some systems have a dual mode 32-bit/64-bit compiler.  On most of
these, XEmacs requires the --pdump configure option to build
correctly with the 64-bit version of the compiler.

mips-sgi-irix6.5, CC="gcc -mabi=64"
mips-sgi-irix6.5, CC="cc -64"
rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.0.0, CC="cc -q64"

On most of these systems, XEmacs also builds with a C++ compiler,
but not "out of the box".  This feature is only for use by the
maintainers.

XEmacs 21.2 (and therefore 21.4) is known _not_ to work on any
machines with m680x0 processors.  Sorry, all you sun3 and Unix PC
nostalgia buffs out there.

VMS has never been supported by XEmacs.  In fact, all the old VMS code
inherited from Emacs has been removed.  Sorry, all you VMS fans out there.
