/*

A "dynamic array" is a contiguous array of fixed-size elements where there
is no upper limit (except available memory) on the number of elements in the
array.  Because the elements are maintained contiguously, space is used
efficiently (no per-element pointers necessary) and random access to a
particular element is in constant time.  At any one point, the block of memory
that holds the array has an upper limit; if this limit is exceeded, the
memory is realloc()ed into a new array that is twice as big.  Assuming that
the time to grow the array is on the order of the new size of the array
block, this scheme has a provably constant amortized time (i.e. average
time over all additions).

When you add elements or retrieve elements, pointers are used.  Note that
the element itself (of whatever size it is), and not the pointer to it,
is stored in the array; thus you do not have to allocate any heap memory
on your own.  Also, returned pointers are only guaranteed to be valid
until the next operation that changes the length of the array.

This is a container object.  Declare a dynamic array of a specific type
as follows:

typedef struct
{
  Dynarr_declare (mytype);
} mytype_dynarr;

Use the following functions/macros:

   void *Dynarr_new(type)
      [MACRO] Create a new dynamic-array object, with each element of the
      specified type.  The return value is cast to (type##_dynarr).
      This requires following the convention that types are declared in
      such a way that this type concatenation works.  In particular, TYPE
      must be a symbol, not an arbitrary C type.

   Dynarr_add(d, el)
      [MACRO] Add an element to the end of a dynamic array.  EL is a pointer
      to the element; the element itself is stored in the array, however.
      No function call is performed unless the array needs to be resized.

   Dynarr_add_many(d, base, len)
      [MACRO] Add LEN elements to the end of the dynamic array.  The elements
      should be contiguous in memory, starting at BASE.

   Dynarr_insert_many_at_start(d, base, len)
      [MACRO] Append LEN elements to the beginning of the dynamic array.
      The elements should be contiguous in memory, starting at BASE.

   Dynarr_insert_many(d, base, len, start)
      Insert LEN elements to the dynamic array starting at position
      START.  The elements should be contiguous in memory, starting at BASE.

   int Dynarr_length(d)
      [MACRO] Return the number of elements currently in a dynamic array.

   int Dynarr_largest(d)
      [MACRO] Return the maximum value that Dynarr_length(d) would
      ever have returned.

   type Dynarr_at(d, i)
      [MACRO] Return the element at the specified index (no bounds checking
      done on the index).  The element itself is returned, not a pointer
      to it.

   type *Dynarr_atp(d, i)
      [MACRO] Return a pointer to the element at the specified index (no
      bounds checking done on the index).  The pointer may not be valid
      after an element is added to or removed from the array.

   Dynarr_reset(d)
      [MACRO] Reset the length of a dynamic array to 0.

   Dynarr_free(d)
      Destroy a dynamic array and the memory allocated to it.

Use the following global variable:

   Dynarr_min_size
      Minimum allowable size for a dynamic array when it is resized.
