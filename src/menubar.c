Pop up the menu described by MENU-DESCRIPTION.
A menu description is a list of menu items, strings, and submenus.

The first element of a menu must be a string, which is the name of the menu.
This is the string that will be displayed in the parent menu, if any.  For
toplevel menus, it is ignored.  This string is not displayed in the menu
itself.

If an element of a menu is a string, then that string will be presented in
the menu as unselectable text.

If an element of a menu is a string consisting solely of hyphens, then that
item will be presented as a solid horizontal line.

If an element of a menu is a list, it is treated as a submenu.  The name of
that submenu (the first element in the list) will be used as the name of the
item representing this menu on the parent.

Otherwise, the element must be a vector, which describes a menu item.
A menu item can have any of the following forms:

 [ "name" callback <active-p> ]
 [ "name" callback <active-p> <suffix> ]
 [ "name" callback :<keyword> <value>  :<keyword> <value> ... ]

The name is the string to display on the menu; it is filtered through the
resource database, so it is possible for resources to override what string
is actually displayed.

If the `callback' of a menu item is a symbol, then it must name a command.
It will be invoked with `call-interactively'.  If it is a list, then it is
evaluated with `eval'.

The possible keywords are this:

 :active   <form>    Same as <active-p> in the first two forms: the
                     expression is evaluated just before the menu is
                     displayed, and the menu will be selectable only if
                     the result is non-nil.

 :suffix   <form>    Same as <suffix> in the second form: the expression
                     is evaluated just before the menu is displayed and
		     resulting string is appended to the displayed name,
		     providing a convenient way of adding the name of a
		     command's ``argument'' to the menu, like
		     ``Kill Buffer NAME''.

 :keys     "string"  Normally, the keyboard equivalents of commands in
                     menus are displayed when the `callback' is a symbol.
                     This can be used to specify keys for more complex menu
                     items.  It is passed through `substitute-command-keys'
                     first.

 :style    <style>   Specifies what kind of object this menu item is:

                        nil     A normal menu item.
                        toggle  A toggle button.
                        radio   A radio button.

                     The only difference between toggle and radio buttons is
                     how they are displayed.  But for consistency, a toggle
                     button should be used when there is one option whose
                     value can be turned on or off, and radio buttons should
                     be used when there is a set of mutually exclusive
                     options.  When using a group of radio buttons, you
                     should arrange for no more than one to be marked as
                     selected at a time.

 :selected <form>    Meaningful only when STYLE is `toggle' or `radio'.
                     This specifies whether the button will be in the
                     selected or unselected state.

For example:

 [ "Save As..."    write-file  t ]
 [ "Revert Buffer" revert-buffer (buffer-modified-p) ]
 [ "Read Only"     toggle-read-only :style toggle :selected buffer-read-only ]

The current menubar.  This may be buffer-local.

When the menubar is changed, the function `set-menubar-dirty-flag' has to
be called for the menubar to be updated on the frame.  See `set-menubar'
and `set-buffer-menubar'.

A menubar is a list of menus and menu-items.
A menu is a list of menu items, keyword-value pairs, strings, and submenus.

The first element of a menu must be a string, which is the name of the menu.
This is the string that will be displayed in the parent menu, if any.  For
toplevel menus, it is ignored.  This string is not displayed in the menu
itself.

Menu accelerators can be indicated in the string by putting the
sequence "%_" before the character corresponding to the key that will
invoke the menu or menu item.  Uppercase and lowercase accelerators
are equivalent.  The sequence "%%" is also special, and is translated
into a single %.

If no menu accelerator is present in the string, XEmacs will act as if
the first character has been tagged as an accelerator.

Immediately following the name string of the menu, various optional
keyword-value pairs are permitted: currently, :filter, :active, :included,
and :config. (See below.)

If an element of a menu (or menubar) is a string, then that string will be
presented as unselectable text.

If an element of a menu is a string consisting solely of hyphens, then that
item will be presented as a solid horizontal line.

If an element of a menu is a string beginning with "--:", it will be
presented as a line whose appearance is controlled by the rest of the
text in the string.  The allowed line specs are system-dependent, and
currently work only under X Windows (with Lucid and Motif menubars);
otherwise, a solid horizontal line is presented, as if the string were
all hyphens.

The possibilities are:

  "--:singleLine"
  "--:doubleLine"
  "--:singleDashedLine"
  "--:doubleDashedLine"
  "--:noLine"
  "--:shadowEtchedIn"
  "--:shadowEtchedOut"
  "--:shadowEtchedInDash"
  "--:shadowEtchedOutDash"
  "--:shadowDoubleEtchedIn" (Lucid menubars only)
  "--:shadowDoubleEtchedOut" (Lucid menubars only)
  "--:shadowDoubleEtchedInDash" (Lucid menubars only)
  "--:shadowDoubleEtchedOutDash" (Lucid menubars only)

If an element of a menu is a list, it is treated as a submenu.  The name of
that submenu (the first element in the list) will be used as the name of the
item representing this menu on the parent.

If an element of a menubar is `nil', then it is used to represent the
division between the set of menubar-items which are flushleft and those
which are flushright.

Otherwise, the element must be a vector, which describes a menu item.
A menu item is of the following form:

 [ "name" callback :<keyword> <value> :<keyword> <value> ... ]

The following forms are also accepted for compatibility, but deprecated:

 [ "name" callback <active-p> ]
 [ "name" callback <active-p> <suffix> ]

The name is the string to display on the menu; it is filtered through the
resource database, so it is possible for resources to override what string
is actually displayed.  Menu accelerator indicators (the sequence `%_') are
also processed; see above.  If the name is not a string, it will be
evaluated with `eval', and the result should be a string.

If the `callback' of a menu item is a symbol, then it must name a command.
It will be invoked with `call-interactively'.  If it is a list, then it is
evaluated with `eval'.

In the deprecated forms, <active-p> is equivalent to using the :active
keyword, and <suffix> is equivalent to using the :suffix keyword.

The possible keywords are:

 :active   <form>    The expression is evaluated just before the menu is
                     displayed, and the menu will be selectable only if
                     the result is non-nil.

 :suffix   <form>    The expression is evaluated just before the menu is
                     displayed and the resulting string is appended to
                     the displayed name, providing a convenient way of
                     adding the name of a command's ``argument'' to the
                     menu, like ``Kill Buffer NAME''.

 :keys     "string"  Normally, the keyboard equivalents of commands in
                     menus are displayed when the `callback' is a symbol.
                     This can be used to specify keys for more complex menu
                     items.  It is passed through `substitute-command-keys'
                     first.

 :style    <style>   Specifies what kind of object this menu item is:

                        nil     A normal menu item.
                        toggle  A toggle button.
                        radio   A radio button.
                        button  A menubar button.

                     The only difference between toggle and radio buttons is
                     how they are displayed.  But for consistency, a toggle
                     button should be used when there is one option whose
                     value can be turned on or off, and radio buttons should
                     be used when there is a set of mutually exclusive
                     options.  When using a group of radio buttons, you
                     should arrange for no more than one to be marked as
                     selected at a time.

 :selected <form>    Meaningful only when STYLE is `toggle', `radio' or
                     `button'.  This specifies whether the button will be in
		     the selected or unselected state.

 :included <form>    This can be used to control the visibility of a menu or
		     menu item.  The form is evaluated and the menu or menu
		     item is only displayed if the result is non-nil.

 :config  <symbol>   This is an efficient shorthand for
		         :included (memq symbol menubar-configuration)
	             See the variable `menubar-configuration'.

 :filter <function>  A menu filter can only be used at the beginning of a
                     submenu description (i.e. not in a menu item itself).
		     (Remember that most of the keywords can take evaluated
		     expressions as well as constants.)  The filter is used to
		     incrementally create a submenu only when it is selected
                     by the user and not every time the menubar is activated.
                     The filter function is passed the list of menu items in
                     the submenu and must return the modified list to be
		     actually used.  The filter MUST NOT destructively modify
                     the list of menu items passed to it.  It is called only
		     when the menu is about to be displayed, so other menus
		     may already be displayed.  Vile and terrible things will
		     happen if a menu filter function changes the current
		     buffer, window, or frame.  It also should not raise,
		     lower, or iconify any frames.  Basically, the filter
		     function should have no side-effects.

 :key-sequence keys  Used in FSF Emacs as an hint to an equivalent keybinding.
                     Ignored by XEmacs for easymenu.el compatibility.
		     (XEmacs computes this information automatically.)

For example:

 ("%_File"
  :filter file-menu-filter	; file-menu-filter is a function that takes

				; returns a list of menu items
  [ "Save %_As..."    write-file  t ]
  [ "%_Revert Buffer" revert-buffer (buffer-modified-p) ]
  [ "R%_ead Only"     toggle-read-only :style toggle
		      :selected buffer-read-only ]
  )

See menubar-items.el for many more examples.

After the menubar is clicked upon, but before any menus are popped up,
the functions on the `activate-menubar-hook' are invoked to make top-level
changes to the menus and menubar.  Note, however, that the use of menu

menu-force is used to indicate that the menu accelerator key takes
precedence over bindings in the current keymap(s).  menu-fallback means
that bindings in the current keymap take precedence over menu accelerator keys.

keypress of Meta-t if menu-accelerator-enabled is menu-force.
However, if menu-accelerator-enabled is menu-fallback, then
Meta-t will not activate the menubar and will instead run the function

The actions menu-quit, menu-up, menu-down, menu-left, menu-right,

NOTE: This currently only has any effect under X Windows.

menu-quit    Immediately deactivate the menubar and any open submenus without
             selecting an item.
menu-up      Move the menu cursor up one row in the current menu.  If the
             move extends past the top of the menu, wrap around to the bottom.
menu-down    Move the menu cursor down one row in the current menu.  If the
             move extends past the bottom of the menu, wrap around to the top.
             If executed while the cursor is in the top level menu, move down
             into the selected menu.
menu-left    Move the cursor from a submenu into the parent menu.  If executed
             while the cursor is in the top level menu, move the cursor to the
             left.  If the move extends past the left edge of the menu, wrap
             around to the right edge.
menu-right   Move the cursor into a submenu.  If the cursor is located in the
             top level menu or is not currently on a submenu heading, then move
             the cursor to the next top level menu entry.  If the move extends
             past the right edge of the menu, wrap around to the left edge.
menu-select  Activate the item under the cursor.  If the cursor is located on
             a submenu heading, then move the cursor into the submenu.
menu-escape  Pop up to the next level of menus.  Moves from a submenu into its
             parent menu.  From the top level menu, this deactivates the
             menubar.

This keymap can also contain normal key-command bindings, in which case the
menubar is deactivated and the corresponding command is executed.

The action bindings used by the menu accelerator code are designed to mimic
the actions of menu traversal keys in a commonly used PC operating system.
