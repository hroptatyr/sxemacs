/* EMACS_TIME is the type to use to represent temporal intervals.
   At one point this was 'struct timeval' on some systems, int on others.
   But this is stupid.  Other things than select() code like to
   manipulate time values, and so microsecond precision should be
   maintained.  Separate typedefs and conversion functions are provided
   for select().

   EMACS_SECS (TIME) is an rvalue for the seconds component of TIME.
   EMACS_SET_SECS (TIME, SECONDS) sets that to SECONDS.

   EMACS_USECS (TIME) is an rvalue for the microseconds component of TIME.
   EMACS_SET_USECS (TIME, MICROSECONDS) sets that to MICROSECONDS.

   Note that all times are returned in "normalized" format (i.e. the
   usecs value is in the range 0 <= value < 1000000) and are assumed
   to be passed in in this format.

   EMACS_SET_SECS_USECS (TIME, SECS, USECS) sets both components of TIME.

   EMACS_GET_TIME (TIME) stores the current system time in TIME, which
	should be an lvalue.

   set_file_times (PATH, ATIME, MTIME) changes the last-access and
	last-modification times of the file named PATH to ATIME and
	MTIME, which are EMACS_TIMEs.

   EMACS_NORMALIZE_TIME (TIME) coerces TIME into normalized format.

   EMACS_ADD_TIME (DEST, SRC1, SRC2) adds SRC1 to SRC2 and stores the
	result in DEST.  Either or both may be negative.

   EMACS_SUB_TIME (DEST, SRC1, SRC2) subtracts SRC2 from SRC1 and
	stores the result in DEST.  Either or both may be negative.

   EMACS_TIME_NEG_P (TIME) is true iff TIME is negative.

   EMACS_TIME_EQUAL (TIME1, TIME2) is true iff TIME1 is the same as TIME2.
   EMACS_TIME_GREATER (TIME1, TIME2) is true iff TIME1 is greater than
        TIME2.
   EMACS_TIME_EQUAL_OR_GREATER (TIME1, TIME2) is true iff TIME1 is
        greater than or equal to TIME2.

/* #### Move this comment elsewhere when we figure out the place.

   "qxe" is a unique prefix used to identify encapsulations of standard
   library functions.  We used to play pre-processing games but in
   general this leads to nothing but trouble because someone first
   encountering the code will have no idea that what appears to be a
   call to a library function has actually been redefined to be a call
   somewhere else.  This is doubly true when the redefinition occurs
   in out-of-the way s+m files and only on certainly systems.

   By making the encapsulation explicit we might be making the code
   that uses is slightly less pretty, but this is more than compensated
   for by the huge increase in clarity.

   "Standard library function" can refer to any function in any
   standard library.  If we are explicitly changing the semantics
   (e.g. Mule-encapsulating), we should use an extended version of
   the prefix, e.g. perhaps "qxe_xlat_" for functions that Mule-
   encapsulate, or "qxe_retry_" for functions that automatically
   retry a system call interrupted by EINTR.  In general, if there
   is no prefix extension, it means the function is trying to
   provide (more or less) the same semantics as the standard library
   function; but be aware that the reimplementation may be incomplete
   or differ in important respects.  This is especially the case
   when attempts are made to implement Unix functions on MS Windows.
