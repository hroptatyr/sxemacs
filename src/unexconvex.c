/*
 * unexec.c - Convert a running program into an a.out file.
 *
 * Author:	Spencer W. Thomas
 * 		Computer Science Dept.
 * 		University of Utah
 * Date:	Tue Mar  2 1982
 * Modified heavily since then.
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *	unexec (new_name, a_name, data_start, bss_start, entry_address)
 *	char *new_name, *a_name;
 *	unsigned data_start, bss_start, entry_address;
 *
 * Takes a snapshot of the program and makes an a.out format file in the
 * file named by the string argument new_name.
 * If a_name is non-NULL, the symbol table will be taken from the given file.
 * On some machines, an existing a_name file is required.
 *
 * The boundaries within the a.out file may be adjusted with the data_start
 * and bss_start arguments.  Either or both may be given as 0 for defaults.
 *
 * Data_start gives the boundary between the text segment and the data
 * segment of the program.  The text segment can contain shared, read-only
 * program code and literal data, while the data segment is always unshared
 * and unprotected.  Data_start gives the lowest unprotected address.
 * The value you specify may be rounded down to a suitable boundary
 * as required by the machine you are using.
 *
 * Specifying zero for data_start means the boundary between text and data
 * should not be the same as when the program was loaded.
 * If NO_REMAP is defined, the argument data_start is ignored and the
 * segment boundaries are never changed.
 *
 * Bss_start indicates how much of the data segment is to be saved in the
 * a.out file and restored when the program is executed.  It gives the lowest
 * unsaved address, and is rounded up to a page boundary.  The default when 0
 * is given assumes that the entire data segment is to be stored, including
 * the previous data and bss as well as any additional storage allocated with
 * break (2).
 *
 * The new file is set up to start at entry_address.
 *
 * If you make improvements I'd like to get them too.

/* There are several compilation parameters affecting unexec:

* COFF

Define this if your system uses COFF for executables.
Otherwise we assume you use Berkeley format.

* NO_REMAP

Define this if you do not want to try to save Emacs's pure data areas
as part of the text segment.

Saving them as text is good because it allows users to share more.

However, on machines that locate the text area far from the data area,
the boundary cannot feasibly be moved.  Such machines require
NO_REMAP.

Also, remapping can cause trouble with the built-in startup routine
/lib/crt0.o, which defines `environ' as an initialized variable.
Dumping `environ' as pure does not work!  So, to use remapping,
you must write a startup routine for your machine in Emacs's crt0.c.
If NO_REMAP is defined, Emacs uses the system's crt0.o.

* SECTION_ALIGNMENT

Some machines that use COFF executables require that each section
start on a certain boundary *in the COFF file*.  Such machines should
define SECTION_ALIGNMENT to a mask of the low-order bits that must be
zero on such a boundary.  This mask is used to control padding between
segments in the COFF file.

If SECTION_ALIGNMENT is not defined, the segments are written
consecutively with no attempt at alignment.  This is right for
unmodified system V.

* SEGMENT_MASK

Some machines require that the beginnings and ends of segments
*in core* be on certain boundaries.  For most machines, a page
boundary is sufficient.  That is the default.  When a larger
boundary is needed, define SEGMENT_MASK to a mask of
the bits that must be zero on such a boundary.

* A_TEXT_OFFSET(HDR)

Some machines count the a.out header as part of the size of the text
segment (a_text); they may actually load the header into core as the
first data in the text segment.  Some have additional padding between
the header and the real text of the program that is counted in a_text.

For these machines, define A_TEXT_OFFSET(HDR) to examine the header
structure HDR and return the number of bytes to add to `a_text'
before writing it (above and beyond the number of bytes of actual
program text).  HDR's standard fields are already correct, except that
this adjustment to the `a_text' field has not yet been made;
thus, the amount of offset can depend on the data in the file.
  
* A_TEXT_SEEK(HDR)

If defined, this macro specifies the number of bytes to seek into the
a.out file before starting to write the text segment.a

* EXEC_MAGIC

For machines using COFF, this macro, if defined, is a value stored
into the magic number field of the output file.

* ADJUST_EXEC_HEADER

This macro can be used to generate statements to adjust or
initialize nonstandard fields in the file header

* ADDR_CORRECT(ADDR)

Macro to correct an int which is the bit pattern of a pointer to a byte
into an int which is the number of a byte.

This macro has a default definition which is usually right.
This default definition is a no-op on most machines (where a
pointer looks like an int) but not on all machines.
