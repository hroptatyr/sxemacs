NOTE-START
Sun with 68881 co-processor (-machine=sun3-68881;
			     -opsystem=bsd4-2 or -opsystem=sunos4)

  Versions 1, 2, and 3 of the operating system are derived from
  Berkeley 4.2, meaning that you should use -opsystem=bsd4-2.

  For SunOS release 4 on a Sun 3 with a 68881, use -machine=sun3-68881
  and -opsystem=sunos4.  See the file share-lib/SUNBUG for how to
  solve problems caused by bugs in the "export" version of SunOS 4.
