   operating system this machine is likely to run.
   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
Intel 386 (-machine=intel386 or -machine=is386.h)

  The possibilities for -opsystem are: bsd4-2, usg5-2-2, usg5-3,
  isc2-2, 386-ix, esix, or xenix.

  18.58 should support a wide variety of operating systems.
  Use isc2-2 for Interactive 386/ix version 2.2.
  Use 386ix for prior versions.
  Use esix for Esix.  It isn't clear what to do on an SCO system.

  -machine=is386 is used for an Integrated Solutions 386 machine.
  It may also be correct for Microport systems.
