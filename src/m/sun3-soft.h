Sun with software floating point (-machine=sun3-soft;
			          -opsystem=bsd4-2 or -opsystem=sunos4)

  Versions 1, 2, and 3 of the operating system are derived from
  Berkeley 4.2, meaning that you should use -opsystem=bsd4-2.

  If you want to use software floating point on SunOS release 4 on a
  Sun 3, use -machine=sun3-68881 and -opsystem=sunos4.  See the file
  share-lib/SUNBUG for how to solve problems caused by bugs in the
  "export" version of SunOS 4.
