/* Jim Wilson writes:
   [...] The X11 include files that Dec distributes with Ultrix
   are bogus.

   When __STDC__ is defined (which is true with gcc), the X11 include files
   try to define prototypes.  The prototypes however use types which haven't
   been defined yet, and thus we get syntax/parse errors.

   You can not fix this by changing the include files, because the prototypes
   create circular dependencies, in particular Xutil.h depends on types defined
   in Xlib.h, and Xlib.h depends on types defined in Xutil.h.  So, no matter
   which order you try to include them in, it will still fail.

   Compiling with -DNeedFunctionPrototypes=0 will solve the problem by
   directly inhibiting the bad prototypes.  This could perhaps just be put in
   an a Ultrix configuration file.

   Using the MIT X11 distribution instead of the one provided by Dec will
   also solve the problem, but I doubt you can convince everyone to do this. */

/* Addendum: the MIT X11 distribution neglects to define certain symbols
   when NeedFunctionPrototypes is 0, but still tries to use them when
   NeedVarargsPrototypes is 1 (which is its default value).  So if we're
   going to disable non-variadic prototypes, we also need to disable
   variadic prototypes.  --kwzh@gnu.ai.mit.edu */
