/***
 * This header is just a convenience thing. Projects using SXEmacs will solely
 * need to include this one and will not have to care about additional stuff.
 * In particular this simplifies include paths since we might not be the only
 * project on this earth with a lisp.h header and we are definitely not the
 * only ones with a process.h file.  Thus, to avoid confusion because of
 * mistakenly included files from other projects we provide this meta-header.
 *
 * To use this in your emodules (or wherever) install SXEmacs (>= 22.1.7)
 * properly (or assume it has been done already), then invoke pkg-config to
 * determine the include path of the latest and greatest SXEmacs on your/that
 * box, like so:
 *
 *	pkg-config --cflags sxemacs
 *
 * and save that value somehow, say to SXE_CPPFLAGS, then as your final
 * CPPFLAGS you'd use "${YOUR_CPPFLAGS} ${SXE_CPPFLAGS}" in the Makefile (or
 * whatever system you're using).  It's probably not the fastest way to do but
 * of course you could just invoke your C compiler like so:
 *
 *	gcc $(pkg-config --cflags sxemacs) ...
 *
 * In your project, thence, just use
 *
 *	#include <sxemacs.h>
 *
 * and forget about all the other include files.  Of course, you can include
 * sxemacs.h as many times as you like.
 *
 * Easy, innit? :)
