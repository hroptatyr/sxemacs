/*
   A relocating allocator built using the mmap(2) facility available
   in some OSes.  Based on another version written by Paul Flinders,
   from which code (and comments) are snarfed.

   The OS should support mmap() with MAP_ANONYMOUS attribute, or have
   /dev/zero.  It should support private memory mapping.

   Paul Flinders wrote a version which works well for systems that
   allow callers to specify (virtual) addresses to mmap().
   Unfortunately, such a scheme doesn't work for certain systems like
   HP-UX that have a system-wide virtual->real address map, and
   consequently impose restrictions on the virtual address values
   permitted.

   NB: The mapping scheme in HP-UX is motivated by the inverted page
   table design in some HP processors.

   This alternate implementation allows for the addresses to be
   optionally chosen by the system.  Fortunately, buffer allocation
   doesn't insist upon contiguous memory which Flinders' scheme
   provides, and this one doesn't.

   We don't really provide for hysteresis here, but add some metering
   to monitor how poorly the allocator actually works.  See the
   documentation for `mmap-hysteresis'.

   This implementation actually cycles through the blocks allocated
   via mmap() and only sends it to free() if it wasn't one of them.
   Unfortunately, this is O(n) in the number of mmapped blocks.  (Not
   really, as we have a hash table which tries to reduce the cost.)
   Also, this dereferences the pointer passed, so it would cause a
   segfault if garbage was passed to it.  */

   Some kernels don't like being asked to pick addresses for mapping
   themselves---IRIX is known to become extremely slow if mmap is
   passed a ZERO as the first argument.  In such cases, we use an
   address map which is managed local to the SXEmacs process.  The
   address map maintains an ordered linked list of (address, size,
   occupancy) triples ordered by the absolute address.  Initially, a
   large address area is marked as being empty.  The address picking
   scheme takes bites off the first block which is still empty and
   large enough.  If mmap with the specified address fails, it is
   marked unavailable and not attempted thereafter.  The scheme will
   keep fragmenting the large empty block until it finds an address
   which can be successfully mmapped, or until there are no free
   blocks of the given size left.

   Note that this scheme, given its first-fit strategy, is prone to
   fragmentation of the first part of memory earmarked for this
   purpose. [ACP Vol I].  We can't use the workaround of using a
   randomized first fit because we don't want to presume too much
   about the memory map.  Instead, we try to coalesce empty or
   unavailable blocks at any available opportunity.  */
