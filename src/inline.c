/* Synched up with: Not in FSF. */

/* The purpose of this file is so that there is at least one actual
   definition of each inline function.  This is needed under GCC.  The
   reason is that under GCC we declare our inline functions `inline
   extern', which causes the inlined version to get used only for
   inlining, and in other cases to generate an external reference to
   the function.  This is more efficient than declaring our inline
   functions `inline static', which (in many cases) would cause a separate
   version of the function to get inserted into every source file that
   included the corresponding header file.  See internals.texi.

   Some compilers that recognize `inline' may not do the same
   `inline extern' business, so on those we just do `inline static'.
   */

/* Note to maintainers: This file contains a list of all header files
   that use the INLINE macro, either directly, or by using DECLARE_LRECORD.
   i.e. the output of ``grep -l -w 'DECLARE_LRECORD|INLINE_HEADER' *.h'' */
