/* Here, add any special hacks needed
   to make Emacs work on this system.  For example,
   you might define certain system call names that don't
   exist on your system, or that do different things on
   your system and must be used only through an encapsulation
   (Which you should place, by convention, in sysdep.c).  */

/* After adding support for a new system, modify the large case
   statement in the `configure' script to recognize reasonable
   configuration names, and add a description of the system to
   `etc/MACHINES'.

   If you've just fixed a problem in an existing configuration file,
   you should also check `etc/MACHINES' to make sure its descriptions
   of known problems in that configuration should be updated.  */
