DEFUN("format", Fformat, 1, MANY, 0, /*
Return a formatted string out of a format string and arguments.

Arguments: string &rest objects

Hereby, STRING is the format string (also known as template) which
consists of constant (immutable) portions and so called format
specifiers (%-specs).  For details on these see below.

The remaining arguments, OBJECTS, are substituted into the format
string to make the result, a string.  The exact influence of OBJECTS
on the final result is described below.  In general, OBJECTS will be
the lisp objects to be printed.

The format string
=================
The format string STRING is basically an ordinary string enriched with
%-sequences (also known as specifiers or specs for short).  The specs
in STRING will be substituted for the according object in OBJECTS, to
be precise with a string representation of the object.  In the simplest
case, the first specifier in STRING corresponds to the first element
in OBJECTS, the second specifier corresponds to the second element, and
so on.

The specifiers themselves look like
%[r$][#][&][ ][+][~][0][-]['][!a][m][.p|*]{sSdioxXbucfeEgGZQFRBC}


Generic specifiers:
  %s means print all objects as-is, using `princ'.
  %S means print all objects as s-expressions, using `prin1'.

Integer specifiers:
  %d means print as an integer in decimal
  %i means print as an integer in decimal
  %o means print as an integer in octal
  %x means print as an integer in lowercase hex
  %X means print as an integer in uppercase hex
  %b means print as an integer in binary
  %u means print a non-negative integer.
  %c means print as a single character.

Float specifiers:
  %f means print as a floating-point number in fixed notation (e.g. 785.200).
  %e or %E means print as a floating-point number in scientific notation
     (e.g. 7.85200e+03).
  %g or %G means print as a floating-point number in "pretty format";
     depending on the number, either %f or %e/%E format will be used, and
     trailing zeroes are removed from the fractional part.
     The argument used for all but %s and %S must be a number.  It will be
     converted to an integer or a floating-point number as necessary.
  Please bear in mind that floating point numbers have a limited and fixed
  precision although the print output may suggest something else.
  The precision varies (depending on the machine) between 12 and 38 digits.
  This means if you use specifiers like %.60f on 1.0 or 1.5 only the first
  12 to 38 digits are real.  Also note, that internally numbers are processed
  in a 2-adic arithmetic, so you may experience strange rounding effects,
  e.g. %.60f on 1.2 or %f on 1e+40, this is because you force the printer to
  be more precise than actually valid.  No error is thrown in these cases!

If SXEmacs was compiled with GMP support the following additional
specifiers become available:
  %Z means print as big integer (convert to bigz)
  %Q means print as fraction (convert to bigq)
  %F means print as bigfr or bigf float (convert to in that order)
     this specifier always converts the argument, regardless the
     value of `read-real-as'
  %R means print as real number (convert to bigfr, bigf or float)
     this specifier respects the value of `read-real-as'
  %B means print as Gaussian number (convert to bigg)
  %C means print as complex number (convert to bigc)

Both %B and %C are actually rewrites to %Z%+Z and %F%+F with the
argument rewritten to (real-part arg) (imaginary-part arg).
Flags are passed on to at least the real part specifier.

Tweaks
======
Using above notation there are several tweaks, so called modifiers,
to fine-tune the substitution.  Modifiers are completely optional.

Summary:
r$  use the `r'-th element of OBJECTS instead the one in order
#   print 0x, 0o, 0b prefix for numbers in a different base
&   use lisp syntax for base!=10 numbers, as in #x73, implies ~
    if non-negative print a place holder ` ' for a sign, `-' otherwise
+   always print a sign, `-' if negative and `+' if non-negative
~   in conjunction with `#' and signed numbers print sign after 0[xob]
0   pad numbers (only on the left) with zeroes instead of spaces
-   align to the left
'   group numbers in groups of three
!a  use `a' as pad character instead of space
m   specify a minimum width of the yielded string
.p  use `p' digits of precision, depends on the specifer
*   use the argument in order to obtain the precision

%$ means reposition to read a specific numbered argument; for example,
%3$s would apply the `%s' to the third argument after the control string,
and the next format directive would use the fourth argument, the
following one the fifth argument, etc. (There must be a positive integer
between the % and the $).

Zero or more of the flag characters `-', `+', ` ', `0', and `#' may be
specified between the optional repositioning spec and the conversion
character; see below.

An optional minimum field width may be specified after any flag characters
and before the conversion character; it specifies the minimum number of
characters that the converted argument will take up.  Padding will be
added on the left (or on the right, if the `-' flag is specified), as
necessary.  Padding is done with spaces, or with zeroes if the `0' flag
is specified.

If the field width is specified as `*', the field width is assumed to have
been specified as an argument.  Any repositioning specification that
would normally specify the argument to be converted will now specify
where to find this field width argument, not where to find the argument
to be converted.  If there is no repositioning specification, the normal
next argument is used.  The argument to be converted will be the next
argument after the field width argument unless the precision is also
specified as `*' (see below).

An optional period character and precision may be specified after any
minimum field width.  It specifies the minimum number of digits to
appear in %d, %i, %b, %o, %x, and %X conversions (the number is padded
on the left with zeroes as necessary); the number of digits printed
after the decimal point for %f, %e, and %E conversions; the number
of significant digits printed in %g and %G conversions; and the
maximum number of non-padding characters printed in %s and %S
conversions.  The default precision for floating-point conversions
is six.

If the precision is specified as `*', the precision is assumed to have been
specified as an argument.  The argument used will be the next argument
after the field width argument, if any.  If the field width was not
specified as an argument, any repositioning specification that would
normally specify the argument to be converted will now specify where to
find the precision argument.  If there is no repositioning specification,
the normal next argument is used.

The ` ' and `+' flags mean prefix non-negative numbers with a space or
plus sign, respectively.

The `#' flag means print numbers in an alternate, more verbose format:
octal numbers begin with 0o; hex numbers begin with a 0x or 0X;
and binary representations start with 0b;
a decimal point is printed in %f, %e, and %E conversions even if no
numbers are printed after it; and trailing zeroes are not omitted in
%g and %G conversions.

Use %% to put a single % into the output.

*Whether LISPM-style active regions should be used.
This means that commands which operate on the region (the area between the
point and the mark) will only work while the region is in the ``active''
state, which is indicated by highlighting.  Executing most commands causes
the region to not be in the active state, so (for example) \\[kill-region] will only
work immediately after activating the region.

More specifically:

- Commands which operate on the region only work if the region is active.
- Only a very small set of commands cause the region to become active:
Those commands whose semantics are to mark an area, like `mark-defun'.
- The region is deactivated after each command that is executed, except that:
- "Motion" commands do not change whether the region is active or not.

set-mark-command (C-SPC) pushes a mark and activates the region.  Moving the
cursor with normal motion commands (C-n, C-p, etc) will cause the region
between point and the recently-pushed mark to be highlighted.  It will
remain highlighted until some non-motion command is executed.

exchange-point-and-mark (\\[exchange-point-and-mark]) activates the region.  So if you mark a
region and execute a command that operates on it, you can reactivate the
same region with \\[exchange-point-and-mark] (or perhaps \\[exchange-point-and-mark] \\[exchange-point-and-mark]) to operate on it
again.

Generally, commands which push marks as a means of navigation (like
beginning-of-buffer and end-of-buffer (M-< and M->)) do not activate the
region.  But commands which push marks as a means of marking an area of
text (like mark-defun (\\[mark-defun]), mark-word (\\[mark-word]) or mark-whole-buffer (\\[mark-whole-buffer]))
do activate the region.

The way the command loop actually works with regard to deactivating the
region is as follows:

- If the variable `zmacs-region-stays' has been set to t during the command
just executed, the region is left alone (this is how the motion commands
make the region stay around; see the `_' flag in the `interactive'
specification).  `zmacs-region-stays' is reset to nil before each command
is executed.
- If the function `zmacs-activate-region' has been called during the command
just executed, the region is left alone.  Very few functions should
actually call this function.
- Otherwise, if the region is active, the region is deactivated and
the `zmacs-deactivate-region-hook' is called.

See the variable `zmacs-regions'.

The same effect can be achieved using the `_' interactive specification.
