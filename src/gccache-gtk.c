/* Emacs uses a lot of different display attributes; for example, assume
   that only four fonts are in use (normal, bold, italic, and bold-italic).
   Then assume that one stipple or background is used for text selections,
   and another is used for highlighting mousable regions.  That makes 16
   GCs already.  Add in the fact that another GC may be needed to display
   the text cursor in any of those regions, and you've got 32.  Add in
   more fonts, and it keeps increasing exponentially.

   We used to keep these GCs in a cache of merged (fully qualified) faces.
   However, a lot of other code in xterm.c used XChangeGC of existing GCs,
   which is kind of slow and kind of random.  Also, managing the face cache
   was tricky because it was hard to know when a face was no longer visible
   on the frame -- we had to mark all frames as garbaged whenever a face
   was changed, which caused an unpleasant amount of flicker (since faces are
   created/destroyed (= changed) whenever a frame is created/destroyed.

   So this code maintains a cache at the GC level instead of at the face
   level.  There is an upper limit on the size of the cache, after which we
   will stop creating GCs and start reusing them (reusing the least-recently-
   used ones first).  So if faces get changed, their GCs will eventually be
   recycled.  Also more sharing of GCs is possible.

   This code uses hashtables.  It could be that, if the cache size is small
   enough, a linear search might be faster; but I doubt it, since we need
   `equal' comparisons, not `eq', and I expect that the optimal cache size
   will be ~100.
