This directory tree holds version 22.1 of SXEmacs, the extensible,
customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.

See the file `etc/NEWS' for information on new features and other
user-visible changes since the last version of SXEmacs.

The file `INSTALL' in this directory says how to build SXEmacs.

The file `PROBLEMS' contains information on many common problems that
occur in building, installing and running SXEmacs.

The file 'README.packages' will guide you in the installation of
(essential) add on packages.

The file `configure' is a shell script to acclimate SXEmacs to the
oddities of your processor and operating system.  It will create a
file named `Makefile' (a script for the `make' program), which helps
automate the process of building and installing SXEmacs.  See INSTALL
for more detailed information.

The file `configure.ac' is the input used by the autoconf program to
construct the `configure' script.

The file `Makefile.in' is a template used by `configure' to create
`Makefile'.

There are several subdirectories:

`src' holds the C code for SXEmacs (the SXXEmacs Lisp interpreter and its
    primitives, the redisplay code, and some basic editing functions).
`lisp' holds the Emacs Lisp code for SXEmacs (most everything else).
`lib-src' holds the source code for some utility programs for use by
    or with SXEmacs, like movemail and etags.
`etc' holds miscellaneous architecture-independent data files
    SXEmacs uses, like the tutorial text and the Zippy the Pinhead quote
    database.  The contents of the `lisp', `info' and `man'
    subdirectories are architecture-independent too.
`lwlib' holds the C code for the toolkit objects used by SXEmacs.

`info' holds the Info documentation tree for SXEmacs.
`man' holds the source code for the SXEmacs info documentation tree.
