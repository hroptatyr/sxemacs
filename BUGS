If you think you may have found a bug in SXEmacs, you should report
it.  But before you do, make sure...

        o You can reproduce it.  This is very important because if we
          can't see your bug for ourselves then we have no hope of
          fixing it.

        o You have read through the "Bugs" section of the SXEmacs
          manual (currently, the SXEmacs manual is still called
          "xemacs")...
	
	    From within SXEmacs: C-h C-i xemacs RET m bugs RET
	    From info(1): info -f /path/to/xemacs.info bugs RET

	o You have checked the PROBLEMS file and the FAQ (section 2)
	  that came with your version of SXEmacs (read the FAQ with:
	  `C-h F'), and also search http://issues.sxemacs.org/ to see
	  if your bug has already been reported and/or fixed.

If you discover that your bug is already known to us but still hasn't
been fixed, you should still let us know about it.  Some bugs need a
little motivating to get fixed. :-)  Unless you have new or different
information about the bug to add, the simplest way of letting us know
you are seeing it too is to "vote" for the bug at
http://issues.sxemacs.org/.
