This patch is meant to be applied to starttls.el from the mail-lib
package.

This patch provides some basic SSL/TLS functionality used by other stuff
in the mail-lib package.  Basically it just pretends to be Josefsson's
starttls.el.  Instead of calling the gnutls binary externally the
internal OpenSSL API functions are used.
