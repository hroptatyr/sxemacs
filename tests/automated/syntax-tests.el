;;; Commentary:

;; Test syntax related functions.
;; Right now it tests scan_words using forward-word and backward-word.
;; See test-harness.el for instructions on how to run these tests.

;;; Notation
;; W:   word constituent character.
;; NW:  non word constituent character.
;; -!-: current point.
;; EOB: end of buffer
;; BOB: beginning of buffer.

;; Algorithm of scan_words is simple.  It just searches SW and then
;; moves to NW.  When with MULE, it also stops at word boundary.  Word
;; boundary is tricky and listing all possible cases will be huge.
;; Those test are omitted here as it doesn't affect core
;; functionality.
