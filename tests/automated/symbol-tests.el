;; Keywords

;; In Elisp, a keyword is by definition a symbol beginning with `:'
;; that is interned in the global obarray.

;; In Elisp, a keyword is interned as any other symbol.

;; obarray, and `keywordp' is aware of that.

;; Keywords used to be initialized at read-time, which resulted in
;; (symbol-value (intern ":some-new-keyword")) signaling an error.
;; Now we handle keywords at the time when the symbol is interned, so
;; that (intern ":something) and (read ":something) will be
;; equivalent.  These tests check various operations on symbols that
;; are guaranteed to be freshly interned.

;; Interning a fresh keyword string should produce a regular
;; keyword.

       (fresh-keyword (read fresh-keyword-name)))
  (Assert (eq (symbol-value fresh-keyword) fresh-keyword))
  (Assert (keywordp fresh-keyword)))

;;; Assigning to keywords

;; You shouldn't be able to set its value to something bogus.
(Check-Error setting-constant
  (set :foo 5))

;; But, for backward compatibility, setting to the same value is OK.
(Assert
  (eq (set :foo :foo) :foo))

;; Playing games with `intern' shouldn't fool us.
(Check-Error setting-constant
  (set (intern ":foo" obarray) 5))
(Assert
  (eq (set (intern ":foo" obarray) :foo) :foo))

;; But symbols not interned in the global obarray are not real
;; keywords (in elisp):
