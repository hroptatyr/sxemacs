@top The SXEmacs Editor


SXEmacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.  This Info file describes how to edit with Emacs
and some of how to customize it, but not how to extend it.  It
corresponds to:

steve@@sxemacs.org--2008/sxemacs--main--22.1.10--version-0

Although, it hasn't had a complete rewrite for quite some time.

This manual is intended as a detailed reference to SXEmacs.  If
you are looking for an introductory manual, see the New User's
Guide.

@unnumbered Preface

  This manual documents the use and simple customization of the SXEmacs
editor.  The reader is not expected to be a programmer to use this
editor, and simple customizations do not require programming skills either.
Users who are not interested in customizing SXEmacs can ignore the scattered
customization hints.

  This document is primarily a reference manual, but it can also be used as a
primer.  However, if you are new to SXEmacs, consider using the on-line,
learn-by-doing tutorial, which you get by running SXEmacs and typing
@kbd{C-h t}.  With it, you learn SXEmacs by using SXEmacs on a specially
designed file which describes commands, tells you when to try them,
and then explains the results you see.  Using the tutorial gives a more vivid
introduction than the printed manual.  Also consider reading the SXEmacs
New User's Guide, which is intended specifically as an introductory
manual rather than as a reference guide.

  On first reading, just skim chapters one and two, which describe the
notational conventions of the manual and the general appearance of the
SXEmacs display frame.  Note which questions are answered in these chapters,
so you can refer back later.  After reading chapter four you should
practice the commands there.  The next few chapters describe fundamental
techniques and concepts that are used constantly.  You need to understand
them thoroughly, experimenting with them if necessary.

  To find the documentation on a particular command, look in the index.
Keys (character commands) and command names have separate indexes.  There
is also a glossary, with a cross reference for each term.

@ignore
  If you know vaguely what the command
does, look in the command summary.  The command summary contains a line or
two about each command, and a cross reference to the section of the
manual that describes the command in more detail; related commands
are grouped together.
@end ignore

  This manual comes in two forms: the published form and the Info form.
The Info form is for on-line perusal with the INFO program; it is
distributed along with SXEmacs.  Both forms contain substantially the
same text and are generated from a common source file, which is also
distributed along with SXEmacs.

  SXEmacs is a member of the Emacs editor family.  There are many Emacs
editors, all sharing common principles of organization.  For information on
the underlying philosophy of Emacs and the lessons learned from its
development, write for a copy of AI memo 519a, ``Emacs, the Extensible,
Customizable Self-Documenting Display Editor'', to Publications Department,
Artificial Intelligence Lab, 545 Tech Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.  At
last report they charge $2.25 per copy.  Another useful publication is LCS
TM-165, ``A Cookbook for an Emacs'', by Craig Finseth, available from
Publications Department, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Tech Square,
Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.  The price today is $3.

This manual is for SXEmacs installed on UNIX systems.

@unnumbered Distribution

SXEmacs is @dfn{free}; this means that everyone is free to use it and
free to redistribute it on a free basis.  SXEmacs is not in the public
domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed
is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of SXEmacs
that they might get from you.  The precise conditions are found in
the GNU General Public License that comes with SXEmacs and also appears
following this section.

The easiest way to get a copy of SXEmacs is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for permission to do so, or tell any one else; just copy
it.

If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest version of
SXEmacs from the anonymous FTP server @file{ftp.sxemacs.org} in the directory
@file{/pub/sxemacs}.  It can also be found at numerous other archive
sites around the world; check the file @file{etc/DISTRIB} in an SXEmacs
distribution for the latest known list.


@unnumberedsec Getting Other Versions of Emacs

The Free Software Foundation's version of Emacs (called @dfn{FSF Emacs}
in this manual and often referred to as @dfn{GNU Emacs}) is available
by anonymous FTP from @file{prep.ai.mit.edu}.

@unnumbered Introduction

  You are reading about SXEmacs, an incarnation of the advanced,
self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor
Emacs.  SXEmacs provides many powerful display and user-interface
capabilities not found in other Emacsen and is mostly upwardly
compatible with GNU Emacs from the Free Software Foundation
(referred to as @dfn{FSF Emacs} in this manual).  SXEmacs also
comes standard with a great number of useful packages.

  We say that SXEmacs is a @dfn{display} editor because normally the text
being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as you
type.  @xref{Frame,Display}.

  We call SXEmacs a @dfn{real-time} editor because the display is updated very
frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you
type.  This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your
head as you edit.  @xref{Basic,Real-time,Basic Editing}.

  We call SXEmacs advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond
simple insertion and deletion: filling of text; automatic indentation of
programs; viewing two or more files at once; and dealing in terms of
characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as
expressions and comments in several different programming languages.  It is
much easier to type one command meaning ``go to the end of the paragraph''
than to find that spot with simple cursor keys.

  @dfn{Self-documenting} means that at any time you can type a special
character, @kbd{Control-h}, to find out what your options are.  You can
also use @kbd{C-h} to find out what a command does, or to find all the
commands relevant to a topic.  @xref{Help}.

  @dfn{Customizable} means you can change the definitions of SXEmacs
commands.  For example, if you use a programming language in
which comments start with @samp{<**} and end with @samp{**>}, you can tell
the SXEmacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings
(@pxref{Comments}).  Another sort of customization is rearrangement of the
command set.  For example, you can set up the four basic cursor motion
commands (up, down, left and right) on keys in a diamond pattern on the
keyboard if you prefer.  @xref{Customization}.

  @dfn{Extensible} means you can go beyond simple customization and
write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language to be run by
SXEmacs' own Lisp interpreter.  SXEmacs is an ``on-line extensible''
system: it is divided into many functions that call each other.  You can
redefine any function in the middle of an editing session and replace
any part of SXEmacs without making a separate copy of all of SXEmacs.  Most
of the editing commands of SXEmacs are written in Lisp; the few
exceptions could have been written in Lisp but are written in C for
efficiency.  Only a programmer can write an extension to SXEmacs, but anybody
can use it afterward.
