This directory contains the Tex sources of the XEmacs manuals,
plus the macro package (texinfo.tex) necessary for processing them.

To make a foo.dvi file from a foo.texi file:

1) Run configure

2) Install TeX and the texinfo package

3) Run `make foo.dvi' in this directory.

The most important manuals are available in postscript and dvi formats
via anonymous ftp from:

ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/docs
